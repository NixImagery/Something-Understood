## The Presenters

Sir Mark Tully was the regular presenter of the programme until production was ended in 2019 but there have been other presenters who have contributed a dozen or more episodes over the years.

```{r df-SU, include = FALSE} 
df_su <- read.csv("../PhD/Data/su.csv")
```

```{r 22-presenter-timeline, echo=FALSE, message=F, fig.height=3}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

df1 <- df_su[df_su$Presenter != "",] %>%
    select(Presenter, Production, First.broadcast)
df2 <- df1 %>% 
    group_by(Presenter) %>%
    summarise(Episodes=n())
dfm <- merge(x = df2[df2$Episodes > 11,], y = df1, by = "Presenter")
ggplot(dfm[dfm$Presenter != "",], aes(x = as.Date(First.broadcast, format = "%d/%m/%Y"), y = Presenter, colour = Production))  + 
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(x = "First Broadcast", y = "Presenter") +
  ggtitle("Principal Presenters")

knitr::kable(df2[df2$Episodes < 12,], caption="*Something Understood*, other presenters")
```
