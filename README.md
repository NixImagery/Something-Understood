# Something Understood

As an educator, the BBC radio programme *Something Understood* fascinates me. It was broadcast weekly from 1995 for 24 years early on a Sunday morning and again late on Sunday night. Listening to the programme in the dark at the end of the weekend, thinking about my week ahead as a physics teacher, I often thought I perceived a pedagogy. From the soundscape of the half-hour episodes, new understanding emerged in the darkness. 

That perceived pedagogy is the subject of my current, part-time doctoral research project being conducted at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [Dr. Mike Lynch](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/michael-lynch) and [Dr. James Lamb](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/james-lamb).
