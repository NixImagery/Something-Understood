It has been estimated that up to a third of our judgments about other people's characters are wrong, yet many of us pride ourselves on being 'good judges' of character. On what clues do we base our assessments, why are we so often mistaken and can we learn to read the clues more accurately?",
A Guru Is for Life,b09cvwr3,TRUE,5/11/2017,Jahnavi Harrison,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Musician Jahnavi Harrison draws upon personal experiences to explore the role of the guru and argue that true gurus offer great benefits as we progress through our lives.<br/><br/>For millions of people in the East, having a guru is as common as having an on-going relationship with a doctor or a dentist. However, in the West, the word carries some heavy baggage, often linked to manipulative figures who exploit their disciples.<br/><br/>With help from the music of Abida Parveen and rock 'n' roll legend Johnny Rivers, Jahnavi reveals that a guru is meant to always remind you of who you really are, and what you were born to do. According to the teachings of the ancient Hindu texts the Vedas, the ultimate knowledge that gurus can offer is how to realise the nature of the self and attain a state of freedom and enlightenment.<br/><br/>According to Jahnavi, a true guru is humble, never thinking of themselves as a great teacher, but rather simply as a student of the gurus that went before them. Jahnavi explains, ""Every guru is meant to have a guru themselves, and in this way acts like the smallest lens of a telescope - which when stacked in line with the others, allows one to examine the wonders of the night sky up close and with sharp clarity."" In this way, the guru acts as a transparent medium for the teachings of their master, and all other masters before - all aiming to be of service in nurturing the disciples' relationship of love and service to God.",
A Joy Forever,b01pt87q,TRUE,13/1/2013,Elizabeth Adekunle,Loftus,Kim Normanton,"Rev Elizabeth Adekunle, chaplain of St. John's College, Cambridge, explores the idea of lasting beauty. A brief experience with modelling left her more aware of the limitations of physical beauty and surface glamour. Her work as a chaplain brings her into contact with some students who are troubled by body image.<br/><br/>She begins by looking at the commercial notion of beauty and refers back to Shakespeare in Sonnet 68 voicing his disapproval of beauty accessories such as wigs: ""the golden tresses of the dead"" and then laments the deception of what he calls ""false art"".<br/><br/>She asks what happens when physical beauty fades, and how it's possible to age gracefully. And she explores the idea of a beauty which comes not from a perfect body but from looking out of the window and inhaling the beauty in our surroundings - as expressed in Fleur Adcock's poem 'Weathering'.<br/><br/>Referring to St. Peter's words of wisdom ""Let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet sprit, which is very precious in God's sight"" (1 Peter 3:3-4), Elizabeth Adekunle then goes on to look at a more satisfying sense of beauty. It is the natural world which inspired the French composer Debussy ""to feel the supreme and moving beauty of the spectacle to which Nature invites her ephemeral guests this is what I call prayer"".<br/><br/>And finally she refers to an excerpt from Keats poem 'Endymion' in which he observes, ""in spite of all, some shape of beauty moves away the pall from our dark spirits."" And so Rev Elizabeth Adekunle concludes that true beauty - music, nature and art - can help us out of the shallow bleak world of consumer fashion and glamour and offer us a way to draw closer to the Divine.",
A Language That Speaks The Truth,b014m6qx,TRUE,18/9/2011,Studs Terkel,Falling Tree,Eleanor McDowall & Alan Hall,"Studs Terkel, the celebrated American broadcaster and oral historian, had, in his own words, a big mouth that regularly landed him in trouble.

A Matter of Principle,b012f7dn,,10/07/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Frank Stirling,"In 'A Matter of Principle', Mark Tully discusses just how far we should go to stand up for what we believe in. Principles are usually, by definition, worth fighting for. They are high-minded, honourable things and when people stand up for their principles, real, positive changes are often made. Yet the risk of fighting for a principle can also be very great and can sometimes cause extraordinary pain without achieving anything at all.<br/><br/>In the company of Shami Chakrabarti, the Director of 'Liberty', Mark Tully examines this paradox and asks whether some principles should be more absolute than others. The subject is illustrated with readings from the works of T. E Lawrence, W.H. Auden, Jackie Kay and Claude McKay and with music from Bob Marley, Joan Baez and Mikis Theodorakis.<br/><br/>The readers are Alistair McGowan and Adjoa Andoh.",

A Place Called Home,b03vcyww,,16/2/2014,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Rose de Larrabeiti,"It is the most human of instincts - to make a home. To establish a place of security and comfort that comes to express who we are and how we like to live. There is no one way of doing it and, for most, 'home' can mean many different things - not always associated with an actual place, but often connected to people such as loved ones, family and friends. A sense of home can also be connected to the intangible, built up through our own private memories and our sense of self.<br/><br/>Mathematician Paul Erdös claimed 'the world is my home' as he spent more than six decades living out of two old battered suitcases, chasing mathematical problems across the globe. Fellow mathematician, Ron Graham, invited Erdös to stay in his New Jersey home. He shares his recollections of this eccentric house guest for whom home was an entirely fluid concept.<br/><br/>Through the poems of Tony Connor, the music of PJ Harvey and The Band, John McCarthy also explores the adolescent desire to break free from the claustrophobia of the childhood home, and we hear personal accounts of clearing out those same childhood homes once our parents have died or moved on.<br/><br/>John visits the home of Cecil Balmond - designer, architect and engineer. Sri-Lankan born, when Cecil settled in London in the 70s, he found a wreck of a house and made it into his family's home.<br/><br/>Cecil reveals what it was like leaving his childhood home to re-establish a sense of home in a new country and city. And he shares the deeply personal recollection of how his understanding of home was redefined after a visit to his native Sri-Lanka coincided with the devastation of the 2004 Tsunami.",

A Spirit of Adventure,b0144rq9,,4/9/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Frank Stirling,"When we are children we love adventure stories. As we get older some of us worry about doing anything risky. Others crave taking bigger risks - explorers, climbers, war correspondents, sportsmen and women - many get addicted to the heightened reality of the adrenaline rush.

These include sleeping under newspapers in Washington Square Park and frequenting the famous 'White Horse Tavern' on Hudson Street where Dylan Thomas drank, James Baldwin worked behind the bar and the Beat poets dropped in.<br/><br/>Her final memories on the programme concern the events of 9/11. On that day she was staying with her mother in New Jersey, idly watching the television when in front of their eyes the towers shook and crumbled, billows of smoke unrolled against the sky and they saw the silhouette of a man falling from the top of the towers.<br/><br/>A terrible silence ensued as the traffic in the surrounding streets stopped. When public transport was reinstated she caught the train to Manhattan and found streets full of smoke and dust and poignant messages pinned on public walls: ""Have you any information, please...?"" Then she saw a man selling t-shirts printed ""I survived 9/11"" and youths breakdancing in Herald Square and thought that despite the worst that could be thrown at it, New York was still alive and kicking.<br/><br/>The programme includes writing by Allen Ginsberg, Dorothy Parker, Harvey Shapiro and Damon Runyon.<br/><br/>The readers are Kim Cattrall and Peter Marinker.",

A Wing and a Prayer,b0707y3n,TRUE,14/2/2016,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Matt Taylor,"John McCarthy explores the sacred and profane place of birds in our daily lives.<br/><br/>He considers the many spiritual meanings birds have for humans. From doves as biblical heralds of the Holy Spirit to ravens in the Qur’an, birds are at the iconic heart of almost all world religions. But how did they get there? Is it their ability to fly which grips us? Or the apparent purity and beauty of (many) of their songs and calls?<br/><br/>Along the way, John explores the parallels between listening to Vaughan Williams’ Lark Ascending, hearing a dawn chorus in Kielder Forest and seeking a personal pathway to the divine. He also recalls a bird-inspired moment of hope during his time in captivity in Lebanon - a memory triggered by the music of the singer, Fairouz.<br/><br/>John meets keen birdwatcher and author, Stephen Moss who tells how his love of birds helped him through divorce and bereavement, and reveals the true meanings of birdsong, which prove to be both paradoxical and far more profane than sacred.<br/><br/>The programme includes poetry from John Clare, prose from Gerald Durrell, and music from Canteloube, Respighi and Chris Watson.<br/><br/>The readers are Madeleine Bowyer and Peter Marinker.",

Using excerpts from their composition, 'The Cave', Reich and Korot explore what Abraham means to modern day Israelis, Palestinians and Americans, and search for some kind of meaning that can cross political and religious divisions.<br/><br/>Choosing readings and music from the three traditions Mark Tully explores what is common to their tellings of the Abraham story and what is unique. He asks whether there can be any relevance in the story for us, in our everyday lives and whether the trust and unquestioning faith that Abraham shows is always a good thing. And finally, he considers whether Abraham really can unite people of different faiths, or, in the end, only stand as a symbol of difference.",

Advent,m0001q4q,TRUE,23/12/2018,Robin Griffith-Jones,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"The Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, Valiant Master of the Temple in London, explores the nativity narratives recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.<br /><br />The familiar tales of virgin birth, shepherds and Magi are intriguing and laden with symbolism and meaning. ""There is far more to them, as they were written then and as they have been read over the centuries, than meets the eye,"" he says.<br /><br />Robin explores Matthew's desire to show that all the events in his telling are there to fulfil prophecies in the Hebrew scriptures. ""In Jesus, Judaism’s most venerable prophecies and vastest hopes were coming to fruition. The prophet Isaiah had written of gentiles and kings coming to Jerusalem’s God-given light, bringing gold and incense and singing the praise of the Lord.""<br /><br />Luke meanwhile with his shepherds and the link to John the Baptist’s birth, has another agenda. ""Luke sees two stages in God’s dispensation for the world - the old order, centred in Jerusalem and its Temple, and the new order, realised in Jesus. In Luke’s grand narrative, the new grows out of the old, confirms it and transcends it.""<br /><br />To illustrate his thesis, Robin introduces music from Handel and Bach and the poetry of TS Eliot and John Donne.",

Agony and Ecstasy,b0520t2c,TRUE,15/2/2015,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Colin McNulty,"If you're lucky enough to have felt it, a sudden overwhelming sense of well-being can be life-changing. Where do these crucial moments in our lives come from? Are they just chemicals reacting in the brain or could they originate from the divine?<br/><br/>John McCarthy reflects on the strange and sudden experience of euphoria. He begins with a deeply puzzling euphoric moment from his own life. Did he feel God or simply the release of endorphins? He revisits the trauma psychiatrist that helped him make sense of the bewildering experience.<br/><br/>John reflects on others' euphoric moments and their different sources - like religious ecstasy, brain disorders, drugs, exercise and music. He considers the mystical experiences of saints - Paul the Apostle's awakening on the road to Damascus, and St Teresa of Avila's sudden state of ecstasy consumed by the love of God.<br/><br/>Before his epileptic seizures, Fyodor Dostoevsky would experience staggering seconds of bliss, which influenced his writing and religious sentiments. In The Doors of Perception, Aldous Huxley detailed his euphoric experiences taking the hallucinogenic drug mescaline. Beyond the short-cut of mind-altering drugs, long-distance runners have often experienced euphoria after pushing their bodies to the absolute limit. The conclusion to Wagner's Tristan and Isolde climaxes with a musically-induced euphoria for both the audience and the performers.<br/><br/>Euphoria takes on many forms, but the feeling is often transformative. Euphoria can seemingly spontaneously enter one's life or can be experienced through the very human effort to transcend ordinary humdrum experience.",

Always the Last to Be Picked,b01fhnsp,TRUE,8/4/2012,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully considers the enduring effects that being chosen last can have on us and asks whether the negative aspects of competition might out-way the positive.<br/><br/>We often think of those who get picked first as the winners, or the best. But Mark Tully chooses to focus instead on those who are left until the end, whose self-confidence is jeopardised in the name of sport, and in many other areas of our lives.<br/><br/>He also questions the underlying notion that our very existence depends on 'survival of the fittest', a phrase that is often used to justify ruthless competition and the rejection of 'losers'. He discovers that the term originally referred to the survival of species that can best fit their environment, often by cooperation rather than aggression.<br/><br/>So is society better for being competitive, or would life improve for everyone if the pressure to be the best was abandoned?

He discovers the oldest - and the newest - anthem, stumbles across the allegedly disreputable origins of the Star Spangled Banner, and uncovers some rather famous foreign fans of the British National Anthem.<br/><br/>But is it time for less jingoism in the music which nations play in celebration of themselves.

Art of Prediction,b011zlcr,,19/6/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully polishes his crystal ball and, with the help of prophets ancient and modern, ponders the value of prediction. Should we be grateful to those who can see the follies of our ways while we are in the thick of them? And should we be more prepared to listen to their foretellings, even if the news is bad.<br/><br/>In an interview for the programme, Julius Lipner, Professor of Hinduism and the Comparative Study of Religion at Cambridge University, explains the prophetic aspects of Hinduism, where the actions of this life can influence the next. He is sceptical about some of the devices used by soothsayers to ensure that what they say can be interpreted as correct, whatever actually happens. He has some sympathy, though, for those who make predictions and expose themselves to our tendency to 'shoot the messenger' if we don't like the message.<br/><br/>Tully, himself, wonders briefly if there is any point in trying to prophesize what is ahead:'To those who will be alive in the future, our present, and its prophecies will be irrelevant, as they look to their futures.' But, in the end, he comes down very much in favour of contemplating the future consequences of our current actions.<br/><br/>It's unlikely, though, that all our predictions will be as prescient as Friar Roger in the 13th century, quoted in the programme as foreseeing, 'optical instruments, mechanically propelled boats and flying machines'.",

Unravelling Dylan Thomas's poem Fern Hill, where delight and joy run carefree alongside the poignant tension of time's relentless force, John asks if these temporary moments of grace are mere fleeting illusion or whether they have a deeper significance.<br/><br/>Is a sense of being immersed in one's surroundings the preserve of a child growing up in a rural idyll, or can city children experience this too?<br/><br/>John joins the former Children's Laureate and author of War Horse and Private Peaceful, Michael Morpurgo, in Devon where he runs Farms for City Children. He shares his insights into what moments of escape from time can give children and how they can sustain us for the rest of our lives.<br/><br/>And Camila Batmanghelidjh, psychotherapist and founder of Kids Company (an organisation that provides support to vulnerable children and young people), reveals the emotional and environmental conditions that allow children's imaginations to flourish - where a state of 'merger' becomes 'the start of spiritual life'.<br/><br/>Readings range from Ted Hughes to Raymond Carver, and Arthur Ransome to Arundhati Roy.

Aspiration,b0b1p4xq,TRUE,6/5/2018,Mark Tully,7digital,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully considers the worth of aspiring to greater things, taking as a starting point Robert Browning's words: ""....a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?""<br/><br/>The programme was inspired by an overheard conversation about whether advertising encourages aspiration or incites greed, and Mark explores how the messages used to sell us things can often disguise greed, and other deadly sins, as virtues worth aspiring to. Conversely, he puts in a good word for the way advertising can lead to a more aspirational world in general.<br/><br/>He also considers the progress we have made which would never have come about were it not for aspiration - from the Suffragette movement to the space race. But the case is also made for not overreaching our grasp, for appreciating what we already have, and for being freed from the anxiety of ambition.<br/><br/>With music ranging from Tom Waits' Step Right Up to JS Bach's, Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, and readings from the work of Jack Kerouac and Soren Kierkegaard, Mark celebrates many people's tendency to challenge the status into which they were born and to aspire to a better life.",
At the Darkest Point,b06s6zln,TRUE,20/12/2015,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Natalie Steed,"At the moment of mid-winter, John McCarthy explores how we cope with dark times, how we express our feelings and how we find a way through.<br/><br/>Dark and difficult times are part of our human experience. On the news we encounter human suffering - on a scale so massive and distant from our immediate lives, whether man made or as a result of natural disasters, it is often impossible to take in or begin to understand.<br/><br/>Most of us have more local and intimate dark times to cope with. Sickness, loss of loved ones, financial worries - these are all examples of darkness that can come in the middle of the day.<br/><br/>And there is also the dark that is pure loneliness.<br/><br/>Since first reading it as a schoolboy, John has found solace in George Herbert's poem, The Flower, which emphasises renewal and return after the dark tempests of the night.<br/><br/>There's a new commission from the poet Jen Hadfield who sends us a postcard from the winter darkness of Shetland, readings of poems by Rilke and Byron, and the composer and sound artist Janek Schaefer tells the story of how he came to create a piece of music - White Lights of Divine Darkness (for Sir John Tavener).<br/><br/>The readers are Joshua Elliot, Serena Jennings and Jen Hadfield.",

Autumn Colours,m000197l,TRUE,25/11/2018,Shoshana Boyd Gelfand,TBI,Max O'Brien,"As Rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand watches the autumn leaves fall slowly from the trees she reflects on the vibrant colours of autumn and the season's spiritual resonance.<br /><br />Shoshana explains that she has always been fascinated by the paradox at the heart of our relationship with the autumn. A celebration of the harvest is accompanied by the realisation that this joy is ephemeral. We know that winter is coming. Robert Frost's autumnal poem ""After Apple Picking"" refers to a post-harvest sleep which is suggestive both of winter and of death itself.<br /><br />The Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot features a ritual in which dry willow branches are struck, causing their leaves to flutter to the ground mirroring the falling leaves of autumn which are celebrated as a vital part of the circle of life.<br /><br />Chemistry reveals that the bright colours of autumn leaves are not the product of death and decay. In fact they exist dormant within the leaf throughout its entire life, but are only revealed towards the end when the leaf’s ""work"" is done. Shoshana likens this fact to adults who discover their true inner colours as they age.<br /><br />Whilst for some the process of aging might lead to feelings of melancholy, as Shoshana approaches the autumn of her life, she's filled with a deep sense of release. She explains, ""at a certain age, we can start to no longer care so much what others think of us. We can allow the true colours of our leaves to shine through a bit more because we have grown into our skin and have discovered what those colours are. And because, of course, we realise that if we don’t allow our colours to show now, there may not be a chance in the future.""",

This situation can be emotionally and practically challenging for all the family.<br/><br/>The term 'home' implies much more than simply a building or a geographical location. It can also be a community, a family, an institution, a sense of emotional well being. Not all houses are a home to those who reside there.<br/><br/>Samira Ahmed considers 'home' and how writers and musicians have explored relationships between parents and children, at this pivotal point of leaving home. The title - Away Being, Coming Home - refers to a cross arts project in which young people, writers and musicians created work inspired by photographs of empty croft houses in the Hebrides, and the stories of their former inhabitants. The programme opens with a poem, Barren, a response to an image of one of these homes left behind.<br/><br/>Includes music from The Beatles, Yo La Tengo, South African bassist and composer Benjamin Jephta and The Smiths.

While meditating, Suryagupta became fascinated by the sound of birdsong, feeling as if she was hearing it for the very first time.

She suggests that attempting to return to the simple and spontaneous innocence of the child’s mind can help us overcome these obstructions, in order to experience moments of revelation and wonder. She concludes with a quote from Henry Miller, who celebrates the benefits of sharing these discoveries with others. In doing so, we can connect deeply with one another, and experience an interdependence that is freeing and refreshing.",

Being Good,b01kjjnl,TRUE,8/7/2012,Mark Tully,Unique,Frank Stirling,"Some recent studies have shown that modern obituaries are unlikely to comment on a person's goodness. The phrase, ""she or he was a good man or a good woman"" is found less often than it used to be. In an edition of Something Understood called 'Being Good', Mark Tully considers why this should be so. Does it mean that we are no longer concerned about personal goodness and, if so, what are we concerned about when we judge a person's achievements in life? Do we undervalue the idea of being good? And is goodness enough on its own? Nelson Mandela has said, ""A good head and good heart are always a formidable combination. But when you add to that a literate tongue or pen, then you have something very special."" This programme explores the values of a moral approach to life and the importance of valuing the good in others.<br/><br/>Mark draws on the expertise of Professor Simon Blackburn, Bertrand Russell Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge, and author of the ethical study ""Being Good"". The programme is also illustrated by readings from the works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, E.V. Lucas and Yi Fu Tuan with music ranging from Edward Elgar and Wladislaw Szpilman to the Canadian band Emerson Drive.<br/><br/>The Readers are Philip Franks and Grainne Keenan.",

Is it the sanctity of the shrine of St Cuthbert? Is it its spectacular architecture? Is it the unique positioning in the natural and human landscape (now a world heritage site)? Or is it the echoes of centuries of history as a fortress, a seat of learning and a sacred space?<br/><br/>Through words, art and music and by speaking to those intimately connected to the Cathedral, Samira Ahmed creates a vivid portrait of Durham Cathedral through the centuries. She explores how it has reflected Durham's changing communities and balances the preservation of ancient traditions with the celebration of contemporary Christianity, art and music.<br/><br/>The programme includes poems by Thomas Hardy, L.E.L and John Ormond and extracts from Pat Barker.

Blunt Speaking,b00y4zr9,,6/2/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Alastair Campbell tries to persuade us that his reputation for blunt speaking is not entirely accurate, as Mark Tully explores the pros and cons of saying exactly what you think. As a guest on the programme, Campbell suggests he has a 'feline' side which enabled him to be subtle in his work as Tony Blair's Director of Communications, and that blunt speaking need not necessarily be aggressive.<br/><br/>Mark Tully invites us to make up our own minds on whether we believe Campbell, before examining the nature of speaking plainly, as we see it. And it's this last phrase which Tully sees as important: blunt speakers may only be voicing an opinion that can often be hurtful and stand in the way of dialogue and understanding. But can withholding an honest opinion be just as obstructive to real communication? Perhaps the answer lies in the sentiments of one of the groups of musicians featured in the programme, Tama, who state ""There are three truths in Africa: my truth, your truth, and the truth itself. Whoever is right is right, whoever imposes their reason is wrong"".",

"Breath, You Invisible Poem",b062hn6j,,19/7/2015,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Emily Williams,"John McCarthy considers the cultural and metaphorical significance of breathing.<br/><br/>For most of us breathing is so continuous, so easy, that it's something we take for granted. But without breath nothing is possible. Breath energizes movement and enables bodily activities. It punctuates speech, and is central to singing and the playing of many musical instruments. And in particular situations, giving birth or meditating, it becomes the focus of our attention and is bound by specific techniques.<br/><br/>John McCarthy explores a range of different breathing experiences. From God's breath of life, blown into Adam's nostrils at the dawning of the World, to the Navajo Indian idea about a Little Wind hidden in our ears, he looks at how the breath has traditionally been understood as something that connects spirit and body. We talk about a first and last breath as marking the beginning and end of life, it's also affected by mood and emotion.<br/><br/>The programme features readings taken from the Sonnets to Orpheus, Book II by Rainer Maria Rilke, Phenomenology of Perception by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's and Breathing by Josephine Dickinson.

Call and Response,b0bgp7hv,TRUE,2/9/2018,Shoshana Boyd Gelfand,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand examines the phenomenon of call and response, one of the most primal human interactions.<br/><br/>She explains that, ""whether we're calling our mother on the phone or crying out to God, when we call we hope for a response. That's because we are social creatures, yearning for connection, so responding to a call seems to be hard-wired into us.""<br/><br/>Shoshana leads us into deep space, tuning in to the Arecibo Message, humanity's first attempt to call out to unseen alien races. The irony is that, if aliens respond we may not even be able to understand them. Shoshana admits that, despite all her prayers, she's never heard the voice of God herself, and wonders if she would understand if a divine response was to arrive.<br/><br/>Drawing upon musical examples ranging from Count Basie and Bach to Simon and Garfunkel, Shoshana reveals that the call and response form has long fascinated singers and composers. She explains she has always been amazed at Bach's ability to write music for the piano that lets the left and right hand enter a dialogue, communicating back and forth through melody.<br/><br/>The communal Jewish prayer of the Kaddish, the electric energy between Baptist pastor and congregation and the beauty of the Islamic call to prayer are all explored as Shoshana considers the interpersonal bonding that call and response facilitates.<br/><br/>She concludes that faith itself can be defined as the ever-present hope that, when we call out from the depths, we will receive a response. It may not always be the response that we were expecting. It may even be silence. But, fundamentally, we call out and hope for an answer as a reminder that we are not alone.",
Can I Get a Witness?,b09tyzgm,TRUE,11/3/2018,Sarah Goldingay,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"Sarah Goldingay examines the idea of witnessing in an age of 'fake news' and rampant social media. Pre-existing assumptions about what is truthful and who has the authority to speak it are being tested. So she asks what does it mean to be a true witness?<br/><br/>""When witnessing we are not merely a spectator, passively watching, or an observer, trying to maintain a sense of distance, we witness with our whole selves. It is embodied, visceral encounter in both the initial experience and in the act of retelling."" Sarah argues that to witness is not just about seeing and recounting, but is also to have an ethical and moral relationship to what's happened. To witness is to be implicated.<br/><br/>Music from the Specials, Chumbawumba and Oliver Messiaen and poetry from Thom Gunn, Liz Walder and Henry Dumas help Sarah in her quest for true witnessing, encountering the conversion experience of John Wesley along the way. She concludes ""By starting to bear witness to the way that we tie our happiness to the conditions of our life-experience, Wesley explains we might begin to observe our lives in a loving way, to see God in all things and find long-lasting joy.""",

Why has the car grown into such a potent symbol, and what does it point to in ourselves and in the world?""<br/><br/>In a search that includes fast cars, car crashes, sat navs and the car wash, Michael reveals that our vehicles have even entered our spiritual psyche - something he doesn't find that surprising. He explains, ""It doesn't seem odd to me to find cars cropping up in mystical or religious stories or imaginings. There's something about the combination of the car as a sealed-off private space, like a monastic cell, and as a way of crossing great distances that lends itself to that treatment.""<br/><br/>Illustrating his journey with the poetry of Colette Bryce, Les Murray and Seamus Heaney, along with the music of Schubert, Janis Joplin and Tracey Chapman, Michael celebrates the mystery and meditative quality of driving and wonders, with the help of playwright and screenwriter David Mamet, whether the second coming itself might be by means of a mid-sized sedan.",

Childish Things,b08vwmsn,TRUE,25/6/2017,Abdul-Rehman Malik,TBI,Jonathan Mayo,"Turning 40, for many, is a time of anxiety and existential crisis. In thinking about what it means to be finally grown up, journalist Abdul-Rehman Malik finds his thoughts returning to the question of what it means to be young - and what of childhood and youth can we still carry with us.<br/><br/>If, as it's said in the Islamic tradition, youth comes to a decisive end at the age of 40, then how can we still hold on to the energy, dynamism and even innocence of our younger years without being childish?<br/><br/>Reflecting on Saint Paul's advice to the church in Corinth to leave behind ""childish things"", Abdul-Rehman finds consolation in the words of C.S. Lewis who thinks that adults too concerned with adulthood are rather more immature than children. He also finds uneasy perspective in the encyclopaedic Hindu scripture Srimad Bhagavatam which tells us how, even in childhood, we carry the trauma of past lives and experience - shaping our adult lives.<br/><br/>Drawing on William Blake's Songs of Innocence, Sioux tribal wisdom, Zen paradoxes and the music of Herbie Hancock and Leonard Cohen, Abdul-Rehman finds that growing up well has as much to do with knowing what of childish things to keep as with what needs to be let go.",

On the special day itself, coloured dyes and waters are thrown as the city erupts in an explosion of colour, noise and sometimes lusty humour. Speaking to locals and visitors alike, Tully gets a sense of the importance of colour to this festival, his city and to Hinduism. Looking to other traditions he asks what different colours mean to different faiths.<br/><br/>And as the rumbustiousness of Holi subsides, Tully is left to consider what parallels he can find in western festivals, music and writing, which might first appear more solemn, but can have their own undercurrents of bawdiness and abandon.",

Crossing the Master,b08ksc23,TRUE,2/4/2017,Abdul-Rehman Malik,TBI,Jonathan Mayo,"Journalist Abdul-Rehman Malik explores the complex relationship between master and disciple. Acknowledging that truth lies in fiction, he describes how the relationship between Obi Wan Kenobi and his former disciple Darth Vader in the film Star Wars prompted this exploration.<br/><br/>A passage written by the former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams defines what a disciple is and a reading from the 19th century Buddhist master Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro helps the disciple discern a true leader. Hindu mystic Rama Krishna describes how Tapobana the Master, threatened by a disciple he thought of as foolish, goes on to make a fool of himself.<br/><br/>Conflicts between master and disciple arise in the secular world too. We hear the music of jazz trumpeter Miles Davis as Abdul-Rehman recounts the tale of the clash between young lion Wynton Marsalis and the legendary Davis. The death of Malcolm X in 1965 showed that crossing the master can have deadly consequences - we hear from his autobiography.<br/><br/>Abdul-Rehman concludes by examining how differences between the master and disciple can be reconciled.",
Cultivating Kindness,b0blgj7k,TRUE,30/9/2018,Suryagupta Dharmacharini,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Suryagupta Dharmacharini, Chair of the London Buddhist Centre, remembers seeing her mother crying when witnessing the horrors of war-torn countries on the nightly news. As a child, Suryagupta couldn't understand why her mum was so moved by the suffering of strangers. It was years later, when meditating on a Buddhist retreat, that the importance of this level of empathy first truly struck her.<br /><br />Whilst kindness and compassion might seem to be innate, Buddhists like Suryagupta believe that they can be actively cultivated through meditation. In this episode, Suryagupta explores the Metta Bhavana meditation practice - an ancient technique for the cultivation of kindness created by the Buddha approximately 2500 years ago. She explains that Metta in Pali translates as 'loving kindness' and Bhavana as 'cultivation'. The meditator concentrates on channelling kindness in a number of directions, resulting in a heightened level of empathy and compassion that has been scientifically proven.<br /><br />Across the five stages of the Metta Bhavana meditation, practitioners direct kindness towards themselves, towards a friend, towards a neutral person about whom they have no strong feelings, towards someone they have a fractious relationship with and finally towards all sentient beings. Suryagupta examines the challenges and benefits that each stage brings with the help of Johnny Cash, Gregory Porter, John Coltrane, Raymond Carver, Rumi and a selection of Buddhist texts.",

Darkness,b01hw62n,,20/5/2012,Stewart Henderson,Loftus,Jo Coombs,"In Something Understood this week, poet and broadcaster Stewart Henderson celebrates the power of true darkness. With streetlamps dominating our modern industrialised world, few people in Britain now have the chance to experience real darkness, but Stewart believes it can have a transformative effect.<br/><br/>Some people fear darkness, others find it disorienting and confusing. These days, we fill our world with electric light and it's only in the deepest countryside that we find true darkness. Yet when we do immerse ourselves in the dark, it can bring another form of illumination, heightening our physical senses and our sense of self. Our surroundings take on new meaning and significance. And the darkness can be inspirational - as Vincent Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo in 1888, 'I often think that the night is more alive and more richly coloured than the day'. Other readings come from astronauts, scientists and pilots, all of whom have embraced the dark and found riches and depth within it.<br/><br/>Stewart speaks to Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. As a child he was fascinated by the natural world, and now his job is to explain the latest discoveries in space to the public. Darkness is essential to Marek's work, but it also has a spiritual dimension for him. As someone who seeks out dark places from which to see the stars, he regrets the light pollution which is driving true darkness out of many places. Marek is a supporter of the International Dark Sky Association which aims to identify and protect those places which still enjoy truly dark skies. Without darkness to heighten our awareness, are we left with a loss of inner sight?",

Notwithstanding it is difficult to ignore the mystical resonance of the sunrise.<br/><br/>With the help of Henry David Thoreau, Vachel Lindsay and Brendan Kennelly and with music from Carl Nielsen, Bruce Cockburn and Ortolino Respighi, Mark Tully explores the psychological and spiritual significance of this particular time of day.<br/><br/>The readers are Hattie Morahan and Dan Stevens.",
Death Be Not Proud,b079m52j,TRUE,8/5/2016,Michael Symmons Roberts,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"Death has been an inspiration to poets, authors, artists and composers throughout the centuries. The multi award winning poet, Professor Michael Symmons Roberts, devotes his debut presenting Something Understood to an intense reflection on the subject, its mystery and inevitability.<br/><br/>Roberts has himself used death in his own work, notably in his poem Corpse which is featured in the programme alongside the poetry of Emily Dickinson and Wallace Stevens. But it's the life and poetry of John Donne, which Roberts cites as his main inspiration. Donne, Roberts explains, courted death as a young man and witnessed plenty of it.<br/><br/>Another life-long influence on Roberts is the music of David Bowie who died earlier this year. ""Mortality, the need to seize the fleeting life we have, was always there in his work,"" Roberts says as he reflects on the elegiac Heroes and tells the story of Bowie's final album, Blackstar and the song Lazarus. ""Many fans interpreted it as a message from beyond the border, from a man who had crossed it.""<br/><br/>Other music includes Vera Hall singing Death is Awful, Mozart's Requiem and John Donne's poem Death Be Not Proud set to music by John Tavener.",

Deserts,b05qy96q,,19/4/2015,Samira Ahmed,Whistledown,Natalie Steed,"Samira Ahmed explores how the idea of the desert has been used in literature and spiritual texts.<br/><br/>Often, in Western literature, the desert is a place of self-discovery for a single, romantic explorer or is used as a place to test ideas and fears about the end of the world. But Samira's first encounter with a desert story was that of Hagar and Ishmael. Ishmael, the first son of the Biblical Patriarch, Abraham, is cast out into the desert with his mother, Hagar. Thirsty and abandoned they are saved by an intervention from God and a promise that Ishmael will go on to found a great nation.<br/><br/>Harsh and difficult places to live, yes, but the desert regions of the world are not the unpopulated wastelands of the Western literary imagination. In this programme we hear music and poetry from people who live in deserts and find great beauty there.<br/><br/>There's music from Steve Reich, Tinariwen and Brian Eno, along with poems and prose written by Laurie Lee, Elana Bell and the pre-Islamic Arabic poet, Shanfara.<br/><br/>The readers are Joe Armstrong, Sirine Saba and Emily Taaffe.",

Desire Lines,b060xyp5,,5/7/2015,Mark Tully,Unique,,"Mark Tully follows the paths we choose to take instead of the official routes laid out for us by others.<br/><br/>Literally, desire lines are paths worn over time through a landscape by people taking the shortest or most desirable route, rather than the one provided for them by planners or designers. They can cut across fields or over busy roads, even between countries. But do they represent a desire to break the bounds of convention, or an instinct to follow the crowd?<br/><br/>Arnold Schoenberg and Franz Schubert take a musical detour from the prescribed channels, while Philip Larkin leads the literary trail off-piste, as Mark considers metaphorical desire lines - behaving, thinking or doing as we want, rather than as custom, etiquette or rules would have had us do.<br/><br/>In the end, desire lines could be seen as evidence of human behaviour triumphing over rigid attempts to control and confine - but might they also be physical reminders of our inherent laziness? Is there not something to be said for taking the long way round?",
Deterrence,b07bt72f,,22/5/2016,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully ponders why deterrence often fails to deter, whether globally, at home, or in the Garden of Eden. He examines the different ways it is used - including to discipline children, to reduce breaches of the law, to prevent people endangering themselves or others and, perhaps most successfully, to stop the Cold War getting hot.<br/><br/>To consider whether persuasion might be a better option than deterrence, Mark chooses readings on the prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920s, the psychological effects of the notion of sin and hell, and the mixed success of corporal and capital punishment.<br/><br/>While accepting that deterrence can be effective sometimes, Mark maintains that it often prevents us pursuing better options, and can be detrimental - not least for Conrad who ignores his mother's warning that ""the great tall tailor always comes"", armed with his ""great sharp scissors"", to ""little boys that suck their thumbs."" Conrad is undeterred. ""Snip! Snap! Snip!""",

Noise is often used as a pejorative term, it's unwelcome, intrusive and unpleasant. But this isn't the whole story.<br/><br/>Academic Dr Sarah Goldingay argues that noise can be joyful and that joyful noise affects us deeply. She explains that noise and unexpected sounds can trigger moments of profound spirituality.<br/><br/>Sarah leads us on a journey into sound, from the gong baths through which people seek healing by immersing themselves in waves of vibrational energy, to the zen art of Suizen in which practitioners play a traditional flute as a means of progressing towards enlightenment. We hear from the poet William Cowper, who describes how church bells heard at noon on a winter's walk affect him on a cellular level, and we visit a Mississippi church where the congregation pounds out a spiritual pulse on the wooden floorboards.<br/><br/>Through these examples and more, Sarah argues that it's possible to listen out for the divine noise in and amongst the din.",

She looks to the natural world in search of mystical or ""noetic"" experiences.<br/><br/>We hear the story of astronaut Edgar Mitchell who believed he had glimpsed divinity when staring back at Earth from space in Apollo 14. Sarah explains that, while the sight of our entire planet is clearly likely to spark a profound reaction, many writers and thinkers have found the divine in the exquisitely small - a grain of sand in the case of William Blake's remarkable poem Auguries of Innocence. Meanwhile, a reading from the 14th century nun and mystic Julian of Norwich describes an encounter with God sparked by the contemplation of a tiny hazelnut.<br/><br/>Drawing on Vaughan Williams' iconic piece The Lark Ascending, Sarah recalls a noetic experience of her own. Walking on a quiet hill in Devon, she came across a skylark singing which then flew upwards dramatically into a darkening sky - a moment she describes as ""ecstatic"".<br/><br/>Pointing out that profound realisations of the divine in nature are by no means confined to the idyll of an English landscape, Sarah discusses the long tradition of landscape painting and nature poetry within the Zen Buddhist tradition.<br/><br/>Sarah concludes ""a grain of sand, a hazelnut, a lark's flight or a mountain's grace remind us that a noetic encounter is closer than we think. Even in the bright lights of a city, we can lift our gaze upward to the celestial beauty that turns above our heads each night to know the connection the depths of our soul has with the depths of the universe"".",

Three hundred years after Jesus died, the Emperor Constantine rediscovered his tomb. Constantine built around it a vast circular church - The Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Move on another 800 years and the Christians ruled Jerusalem. Back home in Europe, they built a handful of round churches like the Temple Church, on Fleet St in London, designed to recreate the Sepulchre's shape and so its sanctity.<br/><br/>Sat in the beautiful surroundings of his beloved church, with the sunlight streaming in through stained glass windows and the voices of the choir permeating the air, Robin leads us on a theological journey deep into John's gospel.<br/><br/>Robin describes the gospel of John as a strange and poetic text that invites us to see ourselves and the world in a new way.

Enough Is Enough,b06k9syt,,25/10/2015,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Rosie Boulton,"John McCarthy is joined by tenor Ian Bostridge and ecological economist Professor Tim Jackson, to consider whether aspiration for ""stuff"" and status gets in the way of personal contentment.<br/><br/>They begin their exploration by considering where our desire for wealth and status comes from, and whether it was ever thus. But the discussion broadens to explore our discontent with other aspects of life, such as sufficiency of time, work, space, looks, faith and love.<br/><br/>They end with Bach's beautiful Cantata Ich habe genug. This translates: It is enough or I am content. The piece is about the very elderly man Simeon at last seeing the baby Jesus when he was brought to the temple. He says:<br/><br/>It is enough.<br/>I have held the Saviour, the hope of all peoples,<br/>In the warm embrace of my arms.<br/>It is enough.<br/><br/>Ian and John discuss the way in which Bach captures this sense of contentment and peace of mind that so often eludes us as human beings.",

The right to pursue it is enshrined in the American Declaration of Independence and the Dalai Lama has called it ""the purpose of our life"". Nietzsche, however, remarked that ""only the Englishman"" strove for happiness. Denominations of many faiths often seem to place more emphasis on atoning for sins than striving to be happy.

Faith in Numbers,b039p0tx,,8/9/2013,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Rose de Larrabeiti,"When John McCarthy was held hostage in the Lebanon he found an entirely unexpected source of sanity - numbers.<br/><br/>Five years and four months, 1 943 days - numbers always defined his time in captivity. They also enabled John to create his own safe world and maintain stability. In this deeply personal edition of Something Understood, John recalls his own surprising faith in numbers and finds others for whom numbers both comfort and inspire.<br/><br/>He discusses his experience with Frank Close, Professor of Physics at Oxford University. What is it like turning to numbers to explain the mysteries of our universe? Scientists often work intensely for years towards new discoveries, and breakthroughs are rare. Frank describes what that process is like - revealing what keeps him going if the breakthrough doesn't come.<br/><br/>Are numbers our method of explaining everything, or is there always some mystery beyond? Fellow physicist and practicing Hindu, Jay Lakhani, offers us his own unique, scientific and spiritual perspective. Numbers are deeply rooted in the Hindu faith and have been since its inception. We discover the resonance of the number zero, rooted in the Nasadiya Sukta, The Hymn of Creation - describing our journey from nothingness to something, from zero to one and then beyond.<br/><br/>Finally, what about when faith in numbers and faith in God truly coincide? We hear from a 30 year old American Christian who used to be part of the Holy Rollers, a card-counting Christian Blackjack team who used mathematics to beat the casinos. Their success relied completely on trust, within their own community and in the numbers themselves.",

She has warned against the dangers of certain therapies that lead to 'false memory' and unreliable accusations against innocent people.<br/><br/>In poetry, Ravi Shankar describes memories as the 'wobbly beams' on which we build our self-respect, and Carol Ann Duffy explores the dark side of a childhood misremembered.<br/><br/>Perhaps Jane Austen's heroine in Mansfield Park puts it best, when Fanny Price proclaims, ""The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control!"".",

Finding Your Voice in a Foreign Country,b00vh99s,TRUE,24/10/2010,Vesna Goldsworthy,Loftus,Hannah Marshall,"In this week's Something Understood, Serbian writer Vesna Goldsworthy asks how emigres and exiles find their voices in a foreign country. Vesna left her home in what was then Yugoslavia in the late 80s, following love to a rainy London. She has lived in England ever since, but it took her many years to feel truly at home in the English language. As a poet, she felt her dislocation from Eastern Europe to the UK meant she had lost her internal voice.<br/><br/>Is there a difference between speaking a language and having a technical grasp of vocabulary, grammar and syntax and truly inhabiting that language, having an authentic voice within it? Vesna talks to fellow writer and exile Eva Hoffman, who left Poland as a child, moving first to Canada and later to the United States and the UK. Eva recounted her struggles to find her voice again in her book ""Lost in Translation"". With Vesna she discusses what it means to belong in a place and the importance of language in building identity.<br/><br/>Vesna visits her local Serbian Orthodox church - housed in a former Anglican church building it is an apt metaphor for her dual sense of belonging. She draws on the music of Chopin, whose identity was so divided between his Warsaw birthplace and his home in Paris that when he died his body was interred in a French churchyard while his heart was sent back to Warsaw for burial, and texts including Bram Stoker's Dracula, perhaps the ultimate tale of a foreigner trying to fit in.",
Fire and Flame,b09lw2xd,TRUE,14/1/2018,Mark Tully,7digital,Frank Stirling,"The spiritual and symbolic power of fire and flame is found in a wide variety of cultures and religions. Flames are an important metaphor in secular literature and art too.

First Impressions,b010dfgl,,17/4/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully asks if we should rely on First Impressions or take more time to form opinions. Can we influence the impact we make on others, and can we be manipulated by those who cultivate misleading first impressions for their own benefit.<br/><br/>Using examples of music inspired by the composers' first impressions of landscapes, and poetry written about first impressions of lovers, and even drawing on the conclusions of research into instinctual judgments, Tully discovers that 'snap' decisions can not only prove trustworthy in the long run, but help to protect us from harm.<br/><br/>But should we always trust our immediate responses, or is there an argument to be made for 'proper' consideration? What are the dangers of acting upon first impressions, and when has it all gone wrong.",

It became much quoted following his TV documentary series The Power of Myth, made shortly before his death.<br/><br/>""Follow your bliss"" has become a mantra for many, but is often misunderstood.

Forests Weaving Magic Secrets,b04d0x1k,TRUE,10/8/2014,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Emily Williams,"John McCarthy asks why we are drawn to and drawn into forests, both real and imaginary. And what do we find there?<br/><br/>From Jean Paul Sartre's Nausea to Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows, woodland has often been seen as magical, strange, sacred and scary. The ancient forests of northern Europe were where folk tales began - the wolf, the witch, the gingerbread house, and the poor woodcutter.<br/><br/>Mostly though forests, whether invented or actual, stand in relation to civilisation and, as such, have a particular imaginative resonance.<br/><br/>In Dante's Paradise Lost, he sees the forest being domesticated, from the dark forest of the Inferno, an allegory of the soul's state of sinfulness and error to the ancient forest of Eden at the top of Purgatory, which is a kind of park under the jurisdiction of the City of God.<br/><br/>Following in the footsteps of the poet John Clare on his walk out of Epping Forest and away from his asylum, John McCarthy learns why the forest is not just a setting for so many stories, it is central to what happens next with rules of its own and a way of intervening into the drama of those travelling through it.<br/><br/>The programme features music by Paul Weller and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.",

Forms of Memory,b08n1xmt,TRUE,23/4/2017,Shoshana Boyd Gelfand,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand examines our differing forms of memory, collective and individual.<br/><br/>Citing the work of neuroscientist Steven Rose, who states ""lose your memory and you, as you, cease to exist"", Shoshana discusses the identity crisis sparked by memory failure resulting from medical conditions.<br/><br/>We hear the words of Oliver Sacks who described a patient with a memory span of five minutes. We also hear Shoshana emotionally recounting the story of how her father, once a radiologist, now sits at home reading his own scans which document the slow deterioration of his brain due to Alzheimer's.<br/><br/>While individual memory is clearly vital to the construction of identity, there is another deeper collective memory available to us. Shoshana argues that, in addition to our personal history, we can seemingly tap into larger shared narratives of love, faith, art and spirit.<br/><br/>Collective memory underlies many of the rituals that we use to transmit our shared values through the generations. One of the best examples of this is the Passover Seder, a dramatic retelling of the Exodus story. Every year on the eve of Passover, Jews gather to re-enact the very first Passover when the Jewish people fled from Ancient Egypt.<br/><br/>The Exodus is only one of many expressions of collective remembering in religious tradition. Christians remember the resurrection on Easter Day, Muslims re-enact Mohammed's journey when they go on pilgrimage to Mecca, Hindus recall the victory of light over darkness on Diwali. Shoshana argues that one of the great powers of religious traditions is that they allow us to access these collective memories.",
Fragility,b0bkpj3c,TRUE,23/9/2018,Shoshana Boyd Gelfand,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand argues that we are all fragile beings and explores the lessons we can learn from that fragility.<br/><br/>Shoshana explains that, for Jews like her, Autumn brings the festival of Sukkot which acts as a reminder of the fragility of the harvest and of the Jews' ancestors wandering in the desert. During Sukkot, Jews construct a small hut outdoors with a roof of leaves in which they are meant to dwell for the entire week of the festival. These rickety structures are a reminder that safety and security are fragile constructs.<br/><br/>Shoshana draws upon the wisdom of Leonard Cohen, whose Anthem is a celebration of fragility and imperfection. The song's central line ""there is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in"" appears to channel the Jewish mysticism of Kabbalah that asserts that fragility is built into the fabric of the universe.<br/><br/>In the west, we tend to have a fairly disdainful attitude towards the fragile and the broken. Shoshana argues that we have much to learn from the Japanese art of kintsugi pottery. Kintsugi potters smash their delicate creations before painstakingly gluing them back together with gold running along every crack. These once broken pots are powerful symbols of the beauty in our imperfections.<br/><br/>Describing her own brokenness following the sudden death of her younger sister, Shoshana explains that, like the kintsugi potters, she has chosen not to hide the cracks, but rather to embrace the fact that they will always be present. Whilst the death of a loved one can leave us feeling more fragile than ever, Shoshana concludes with the words of Rabbi Menachem Mendel who states ""there is nothing more whole than a broken heart"".",

Freedom,b08zzlfl,TRUE,6/8/2017,Jane Williams,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"Theologian Dr Jane Williams examines the nature and extent of human freedom.<br/><br/>Recalling her childhood in an Indian boarding school, Jane remembers her unhappiness as a rebellious pupil in a life controlled by bells. She explains that she saw herself ""as standing in the great company of revolutionaries, demanding my freedom from the school authorities.""<br/><br/>Her rebellion never occurred, but Jane's search for freedom continued.<br/><br/>In this programme, she journeys through the theories of natural selection, psychotherapy and capitalism - along with the poetry of Frost, Cummings and Milton - and discovers that ""there is no place of perfect, unconstrained freedom, in which we have entirely what we want. But that does not make us automata: we do have choices about what we will serve.""<br/><br/>Jane notes that even Jesus had to make choices. ""In choosing to be the Son of God, in every action, Jesus lays aside other choices, but that does not make him less free. On the contrary, it makes him exactly who he is.""<br/><br/>Music from Mozart, Elgar, and Prokofiev accompany her journey which culminates in John Donne's climatic poem, Batter my Heart three person'd God, which reveals that freedom is, ""paradoxically, only to found in being overpowered by something worth all other kinds of choice.""",
Freedom and Control,b00xgs25,,16/1/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully considers the paradox that boundaries and controls can create a sense of freedom and creativity. A sonnet, or a sonata are bound by prescribed form, but in the hands of Wordsworth, or Beethoven they can transcend the rules they depend on.<br/><br/>Using a diverse range of music from Olivier Messiaen, to Ravi Shankar, Humphrey Littleton and the mathematically constructed work of Iannis Xenakis, Mark Tully discovers that structure usually, though not always, allows extemporization which creates something much greater than the original form.<br/><br/>And with the help of the words of others like Bertrand Russell and Stephen Fry who have maintained that constraints enable, or are even necessary for creativity; he suggests that rhythm controls not only music and poetry, but the natural world around us, and can also influence our own spiritual lives.<br/><br/>So do we all need fixed boundaries within which to operate with free will, and is freedom always dependent on control?<br/><br/>This programme is the first of two parts, in the second of which, Freedom From Control , Mark Tully interrogates the opposite view that, for some, true creativity is the result of abandoning all boundaries.",
Freedom From Control,b00xp0rf,,23/1/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"As an antithesis to the previous Something Understood, Mark Tully considers that, for some, creativity is only possible when normal controls are abandoned. To jettison the boundaries which shape our sense of reality and of ourselves involves a great deal of risk and, for most of us, this sounds like a dangerous path to follow. But Mark looks at the artists, writers and composers who have done just that, and assesses whether, in his opinion, their creativity has been enhanced or obstructed by lack of control.<br/><br/>Imagine being given licence to do, say and create anything you wanted, unhindered by what others will think, or how it will affect them. Is there a truth that you might have within you that might be freed this way, and what would you create to express that truth?<br/><br/>And is this where genius abides, or madness? Or both? Can we function as humans and as societies if this kind of thinking is developed, or will we always just tolerate the few ""crazy"" artists who push our boundaries for us, while we remain safe and enclosed?",

God Bless our Contradictions,b01rfy4s,TRUE,24/3/2013,Stewart Henderson,Loftus,Frances Beere,"Stewart Henderson reflects on our inner contradictions. Can they ever be helpful to us?<br/><br/>We often think of contradiction as a bad thing - it means being hypocritical, or struggling with two opposite emotions at the same time. But can that actually have its benefits?<br/><br/>Stewart Henderson explores whether our inner contradictions can enrich our lives. He speaks to Richard Holloway, former Bishop of Edinburgh in the Scottish Episcopal Church, who challenged his Church on its attitude to gay and lesbian people and women, yet remained an active member of the institution. Stewart asks him about his persistent refusal to stop questioning Christianity, and if he's come to terms with his uncertainty about the existence of God. Richard thinks faith itself is based on a contradiction: if we could prove our beliefs, we wouldn't need faith - or doubt.<br/><br/>Readings from St. Paul and F.

Imtiaz explains “""Before I ever tasted it I understood the metaphor of wine and its powerful spell. It was in the Urdu poetry my parents listened to, the ghazals and Hindustani film songs with the recurring theme of ‘nasha’, intoxicating love.”""<br/><br/>Intoxication, especially when brought about by something as pure as love, offers us the chance to lose ourselves, to communicate with an elusive beyond. The imagery of intoxication flows through cultures, enriching art, songs and poetry. Drunkenness it transpires is not always frowned upon. At Purim, Jews are instructed to become inebriated, in memory of their deliverance through Esther. Dionysus offers liberation through wine, a release into exuberant fertility, music and dance.<br/><br/>Imtiaz draws upon the work of the 14th century Persian poet Hafiz and the Sufi poets who, despite being Muslims, used the metaphor of wine, taverns and heavenly barmaids to suggest a longing for God. Music featured includes Joni Mitchell, Jacques Brel and Richard Thompson.",

Grace,b07hwtdj,TRUE,3/7/2016,Michael Symmons Roberts,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"Award winning poet, Michael Symmons Roberts explores the deep meanings that lie behind the word 'grace' and how this and other words have lost some of their original power.<br/><br/>Roberts explains, ""the poet Seamus Heaney once used the phrase ‘the big lightening, the emptying out’ to describe the thinning of our religious language, the loss of meaning in terms that once were common currency to describe theological ideas or mystical or spiritual experience"".<br/><br/>Roberts laments the fact that words like water and wood at one time conjured images of the baptism and crucifixion of Christ, but are now more sterile and impotent. But ‘grace’ is his central theme and, through the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop and RS Thomas and the insights of the great German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, he tries to restore some of the depth and wonder of a word which we have perhaps taken for granted.<br/><br/>Having a hit song using its most famous iteration has not helped. Roberts explains, ""Amazing Grace is still one of our best known hymns…but in the course of more than two centuries of singing John Newton’s story of salvation and rescue, some lines have survived better than others in retaining their power to communicate a shared experience. Anyone today could connect with the line ‘I once was lost, but now am found’. But I suspect the same could not be said for ‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, / And grace my fears reliev’d.""<br/><br/>The music in the programme includes Judy Collins, Elbow and Jeff Buckley’s famous song Grace.<br/><br/>Roberts concludes that it is the responsibility of all of us to restore the power of our language and generate new ways of talking about the human experience.",

""The name of God,"" she explains, ""is said to be the panacea for whatever ails the mind, body and soul. It was the ever present soundtrack to my life - night, day, birthdays, funerals, weddings and road trips.""<br/><br/>Her experience at a Christian school also showed her that other religious traditions say and sing the God's name. She notes that she was ""thrilled to discover this common thread, and the myriad ways that this praise was expressed.""<br/><br/>Using the words of the Psalms, the Sufi poets and a number of Hindu saints and mystics, Jahnavi celebrates the power of chanting in different ways and locations and, alongside the music of Vivaldi and Rachmaninov, she relishes in the most famous of all Hindu songs, My Sweet Lord by George Harrison, who is quoted in the programme:<br/><br/>""My idea was to sneak up on them a bit.

Serendipity differs from mere coincidence - it doesn't knock at the door and you can't go out to look for it.<br/><br/>We know now that the early explorers who voyaged before there were maps and navigational equipment were masters of serendipity. We will hear a letter from Christopher Columbus which reveals very clearly that America was a serendipitous discovery which came about while the explorer was actually looking for a route to the Indies.",

Having Enough,b09jbrv6,TRUE,17/12/2017,Shoshana Boyd Gelfand,TBI,Max O'Brien,"In a programme marking Hanukkah, rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand examines our culture of materialism and abundance, and the prevalent feeling of not having enough.<br/><br/>In the story of Hannukah, the Maccabees - a band of Jewish rebels - have only enough oil to keep the fire in their temple alight for a single day following its desecration at the hands of the tyrant Antiochus Epiphanes. God intervenes and the Maccabees' flame miraculously burns for eight days. Hanukkah is often thought of as a festival of light, but Shoshana argues that its central teaching is about ""having enough"".<br/><br/>Contrasting our fate in the west with that of countless people worldwide for whom securing basic food and water is a struggle, Shoshana remarks that it's peculiar that westerners seem unable to settle upon a level of material wealth. Instead, we try to accumulate as we cling to the notion that having more will make us happy.<br/><br/>Drawing upon the Buddha's teachings, Shoshana explains that eastern religions have an outlook that views all human suffering as stemming from the human experience of desire. The Book of Exodus, with tales of manna falling from heaven, also provides insightful teachings on learning to consume responsibly and avoid excess.<br/><br/>Shoshana concludes that abundance is not a healthy state to be in, but neither is deprivation. The challenge is having enough - not too much and not too little - and finding peace when we have all that we need.",

It's about our very soul.<br/><br/>In this episode of Something Understood, stories from patients Sarah has interviewed reveal the importance, when healing, of a deep connection to something other than ourselves - to our doctor, the landscape around us and to the divine.<br/><br/>With poetry from Christopher Southgate, who examines the feeling of loss following the death of a loved one, and readings from Navajo surgeon Lori Arviso Alvord, the programme dissects what could be called ""healing moments"" - moments where the connection between healer and patient becomes imbued with a transcendent power.",

A spiritual and physical purifier, it is also a force for retribution and punishment.

He warns that we are in danger of treating our surroundings like a 'blandscape'. For Malcolm there are valuable lessons to be learnt by immersing oneself in the local. This might all sound a bit parochial, but there's another way of looking at it. Malcom explains that if we celebrate the familiar, if we move our attention from the general to the specific, it can open up a whole universe.<br/><br/>Familiarity and routine can be associated with drudgery, but Malcolm draws upon the example of the Christian monastic tradition's Liturgy of the Hours, in which each day is divided into sessions of prayer from Matins and Lauds, to Vespers and Compline. These services provide structure, focus and rhythm they're, landmarks which anchor and support the spiritual development of the believer.<br/><br/>The programme features poems from Seamus Heaney and Norman MacCaig and extracts from authors Xavier de Maistre and Linda Sonna.

From tax avoidance, to his opposition to slavery, Thoreau was an ardent supporter of the ordinary person.

Michel explains, ""I'd always thought that John Donne was the metaphysical poet who really 'wrestled with God', but now I think it's George.""<br/><br/>He starts his journey though by referencing the 500th anniversary of Thomas Moore's Utopia, ""a remarkable vision, progressive and impressive in its openness to different beliefs"" and tries to square the author of that with the more familiar Thomas More we know through dramas like Wolf Hall. ""...maybe those two Thomas Mores are like before and after shots, with the seismic events of the reformation, Luther's challenge to historic orthodoxy, causing More's radical change of heart.""<br/><br/>But a main focus of Michael's thinking are the various witch trials and witch hunts that take him through the heart wrenching Salem witch trials, the injustice inflicted on Isobel Gowdie and the extraordinary visions of Margery Kempe, ""she was accused of Lollardy, of siding with the heretical anti-clerical reform movement known as the Lollards, and she made some pretty powerful enemies, like the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Arundel. But it's safe to say that her legacy is a lot more impressive than Thomas Arundel's.""

We humans can’t hibernate as they do, but we do respond to the urge to escape the winter. For that we need a safe and secure refuge, and companionship – things we do share with those hibernating animals.<br /><br />All too often, we feel that we must keep going in winter, ignoring the rhythm of the seasons and rushing around as we usually do. But stepping back from our daily commitments, and shutting ourselves away – hibernating, you might say – can bring us peace and joy; it can strengthen our faith and allow our creativity to flourish. Maybe, like WH Auden, Arnold Bax, Frédéric Chopin and many others, we should all pause now and then and hibernate, just for a little while.<br /><br />Readers: Rachel Atkins and Paterson Joseph",

While the feeling of being full is a powerful source of motivation, many people of faith believe there is much to be learned from the sensation of hunger.<br /><br />The notion of self-induced hunger might seem strange to a non-believer, but Shoshana explains that many religious traditions involve fasting with different reasons for fasting or depriving oneself of food. The Christian tradition of Lent seeks to re-enact Jesus’ sacrifice and withdrawal into the desert for 40 days; the Islamic tradition of fasting during Ramadan is meant to increase self-control in all-areas; and the Jewish tradition of fasting on Yom Kippur helps to express repentance leading to forgiveness.<br /><br />Shoshana draws upon the poetry of the 13th century Persian poet, Rumi, who describes a kind of ""exquisite sweetness"" that comes from depriving oneself of food. But being hungry doesn't always feel as ecstatic as Rumi makes it out to be. Shoshana reveals ""the truth is that following an entire day and night of fasting, I don’t feel terribly angelic. Instead, I’m feeling all too human - my stomach growls, my head aches, and my mouth feels parched and in desperate need of some toothpaste and a swish of water.""<br /><br />Nonetheless, she argues, this process is a valuable reminder of just how much her physical hunger is part of her existence.",

On another level we are all incredibly lost throughout our lives. From birth until death there's no plan and no map, just meanderings and different destinations. How does this feeling of being lost manifest itself in our existence, physically, mentally and spiritually?<br/><br/>Anita reflects on the nature of being lost with Reverend Peter Owen Jones, priest, award-winning television presenter and author, described by the Times as ""the bravest vicar in Britain"". Peter has journeyed deep into the wilderness in the footsteps of St Anthony. In a hermit's cell in the heart of the Egyptian Sinai Desert, he lived alone.

She explains that ""the noise of marketing strategies urge us; drive, goad, beguile and coax us to build our identity in the image of their narrow ideals of beauty, success and happiness. And all the time it pulls us out of ourselves. We are left feeling incomplete, inadequate, discontented, stuck in a cycle of exhausting comparisons. It diminishes us.""<br/><br/>Joanna contrasts this situation with the lives of a group of contemplative nuns with whom she spent time when she was 21.

She examines the desire to leave a legacy that motivates writers, artists and musicians. The music of Mozart is described as ""a gift to the world"", his enduring cultural impact allowing him to achieve a form of immortality.<br/><br/>Shoshana suggests that a longing for immortality may be fuelling our current obsession with celebrity culture as we strive for the fame that will ensure that we're not forgotten. However, the fiction of neuroscientist David Eagleman warns us that eternal life through fame may not be as desirable as we first imagine.<br/><br/>Drawing upon the work of gerontologist Aubrey de Grey, Shoshana discusses the latest scientific research into ""age-reversal"" and ""life extension"". She goes on to examine the different approaches to immortality in several faiths including Christianity, Hinduism and her own Jewish tradition.<br/><br/>The programme draws to a close with a striking conclusion - that mortality is not a punishment to humankind, but a gift.

He hears how humans are helped to learn through habit, and about how habitual behaviours have contributed to our evolution as a species.<br /><br />From Buddhist chanting to the Lord’s Prayer, Mark explores the role of habit in religious life, drawing on the words of Gerard Manley Hopkins whose poem, The Habit of Perfection, outlines the old habits the poet should cast aside and the new ones he should learn to rejoice in when casting off the clothes of a layman and putting on the habit of a priest.<br /><br />The habits we might not be proud of are represented in music by Tom Waits, who, when he plays badly, blames his piano for drinking, rather than facing the truth about himself. On the other hand, the 15th century composer Guillaume Dufay’s setting of Ave Maris Stella, Hail Mary, Star of the Sea, the hymn to Mary in the office of Vespers monks sing daily, is perhaps a more uplifting example of habitual behaviour.<br /><br />Whilst Mark takes advice, from some of the readings in the programme, not to fight hard against bad habits but to try to change our ways gently, he does not take them as lightly as Mark Twain who said, ""Quitting smoking is the easiest thing in the world.

Remona also considers how places as well as people bear children and reminisces about her links to her own motherland, India.<br /><br />Remona examines the sorrow and conflict that can come with motherhood. She describes the impact of not having children herself and the loss of a newborn, and revisits the Ancient Greek stories of Medea and Pandora, who bring death and destruction.<br /><br />The wonders of motherhood are also explored, highlighted by neurological research which documents the re-wiring of women's brains during pregnancy, and the strong bonds between mothers and infants in the animal kingdom.<br /><br />Throughout, Remona contemplates the notion of God in the maternal paradigm and concludes that the power of motherhood moves between beliefs, from the divine down to a human level.

Independence,b0b90pfh,TRUE,8/7/2018,Shoshana Boyd Gelfand,TBI,Tom Glasser,"In an age of increasingly divisive politics, Rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand argues that a quest for independence is harder than it seems. Reading the story of the Israelites, Shoshana discovers that it took 40 years of wandering through the desert before it dawned on them that independence does not mean being on your own.<br/><br/>Seeking independence is not just confined to nation states - it exists throughout one's life, particularly during childhood. Drawing upon the memory of a childhood piano recital, Shoshana stresses the importance of learning to stand on our own two feet before we can freely choose to connect with others. It was a challenge that pianist Paul Wittgenstein was forced to face after losing his right arm in the First World War. His success in achieving independence through the mastery of his affliction gifted the world the exquisite ""Piano Concerto for the Left Hand"".<br/><br/>While the idea of being fully independent may seem alluring, Shoshana studies the meditations of John Donne and argues that his famous proclamation that ""no man is an island"" speaks louder today than ever. Listening to the very familiar melody of America's unofficial national anthem 'My Country 'Tis Of Thee', Shoshana turns to the complex relationship between her country of birth and its former ruler Britain. Breaking apart may cause an initial shock, but Shoshana emphasises it is the interdependence between our two countries that defines our relationship today.<br/><br/>Quoting psychologist Eric Erikson, Shoshana concludes that ""life doesn't make any sense without interdependence.

How does the world seem different from inside a tree?<br/><br/>From Herman Hesse to Seamus Heaney, writers, poets and composers have been inspired by the power and grandeur of trees. The Hindu sacred text, the Bhagavata Purana, celebrates the shade cast by trees and the many uses of their bark, wood, leaves and sap. Their age and majesty inspires respect and, as the Dalai Lama said, ""trees echo the Buddha's words expressing his fundamental teaching of impermanence"".<br/><br/>With professional tree climber James Aldred, Mark visits the ancient yew tree which stands in the corner of St George's Churchyard in Crowhurst, Surrey. Together they climb inside its hollow trunk to contemplate the protective, comforting presence of a living organism which has stood in one place for four thousand years.<br/><br/>James has climbed hundreds of trees all over the world, even slept inside them.

As a child she was the only brown girl in a white neighbourhood. She explains that, in Britain, she’s still “""not quite British enough""” for some while, when visiting her relatives in India, she gets referred to as “the English one”.<br/><br/>Muslims, Remona argues, have outsider blood flowing through their veins. The Prophet Muhammad himself was cast out from society in the land of his birth. Shunned and persecuted by his own people, he, along with a small band of early Muslims, became refugees, migrating from the trials of Mecca to the sanctuary of Medina in what is now Saudi Arabia. This experience of being an outsider, Remona explains, was vital to the leadership of the Prophet when he came to build a new community of followers.<br/><br/>According to Remona, the ability to traverse the worlds of the insider and outsider can be hugely beneficial. By embracing outsider status, we can step back from the action and gain crucial insights into the society to which we belong.<br/><br/>The programme features readings from psychologist Adrian Furnham and influential Muslim convert Leopold Weiss.

Intimations of Mortality,b01m4bvq,TRUE,26/8/2012,Mark Tully,Unique,Frank Stirling,"Death is a subject we are often reluctant to discuss. It is often considered morbid to do so. It has commonly been described as the last taboo. However, some argue that a sense of our own mortality plays a vital part in our understanding of life. Further, that demystifying the process of death can be essential to getting the most out of life.<br/><br/>Mark Tully considers the advantages of being open to the intimations of mortality which we may come across daily.<br/><br/>In conversation with Baroness Rabbi Julia Neuberger he discusses attitudes to risk, memento mori and living legacies. With readings from Virginia Woolf, Kabir and music by Nitin Sawnhay and Gustav Mahler, he asks whether being open to intimations of mortality can bring more to life.<br/><br/>The readers are Helen Ryan and Kenneth Cranham.",

Inventories for Life,b051r6xm,,8/2/2015,Samira Ahmed,Whistledown,Caroline Hughes,"It could be said that humans are list-making beasts. Life is filled with them - shopping lists, to-do lists, guest lists, resolutions, inventories of things we desire, categories of favourite books or songs, tenets of faith, catalogues of things we want to do before we die.<br/><br/>Samira Ahmed delves into the secret life of lists and reflects on what they reveal about ourselves.<br/><br/>She takes her inspiration from a masterwork of list-making - the Pillow Book by Sei Shonagan, written in 11th century Japan - and considers how this writer's drive to itemise her cloistered world in minute detail reveals startling psychological depths that still resonate down the centuries.<br/><br/>Drawing on writers as diverse as Nora Ephron, Woody Guthrie and Michael Ondaatje, Samira considers the magic of a great list, where each individual item enhances the others - whether in a poignant list of longing written at the end of a foreshortened life, a jaunty jumble of new year's resolutions or a heap of entertaining insults.<br/><br/>Lists can also have a dark side - the focus of obsession, anxiety or regret. Samira considers how Erik Satie's compulsive list making might be reflected in his music. Lists can also be a source of pleasure, as can be heard in an archive interview with Judi Dench about her devotion to to-do lists.<br/><br/>There are readings from writers including Michael Donaghy, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Umberto Eco, with music by Artie Shaw, Nina Simone and The Divine Comedy.",
Is Art Good For Us?,b08557zj,TRUE,18/12/2016,Michael Symmons Roberts,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"The poet Michael Symmons Roberts explores the idea that the arts are good for us - body and soul - and considers whether they can be both tonic and threat to society.<br/><br/>He says, ""Art is as various as we are, and its moral weight and status is unstable, unpredictable. In times when people are losing trust in politics and religion, art can start to look like a replacement. But if we put too much of our moral weight and hope into art, we imperil it, and it can imperil us too.""<br/><br/>Some of the great Victorian philanthropists thought art would benefit society and used their wealth to make art freely available to the masses. Whether or not the original Turner paintings offered in a Manchester museum, improved the lives of the working class is not evidenced, but the continued idea that the arts are of moral benefit persists.<br/><br/>Roberts offers the example of Ken Loach's groundbreaking film Cathy Come Home as a sign that society can be improved through the arts - along with the way Bob Dylan and others used their music to effect social change in the US during the 1960s.<br/><br/>But he also strikes a note of caution. ""The arts can act as the conscience of the state, a challenging force for good. But they can equally be used as an instrument of propaganda. Whenever I hear the arts per se being touted as a positive moral and political force in society, I start to feel uneasy."" Using evidence of Nazi propaganda from the Second World War, he also points out that a love of art is not necessarily an indication of a healthy morality.<br/><br/>Roberts concludes that art is not per se a good thing for us, but that he ""couldn't imagine, and wouldn't want to, a life without music or poetry or films or paintings"".",

The programme begins with a blast from Beethoven's great Choral Symphony and the final movement which uses the words of Schiller's Ode to Joy , Freude, schöner Götterfunken, ""Joy, O wondrous spark divine."" He goes on to point out the fact that Jewish history has not been obviously full of joy, but he uses two Psalms to illustrate the fact that despite suffering the Jewish faith is full of joy and the praise of God.<br/><br/>He ponders the uncertain world we live in and the anxiety it causes. Nevertheless he says ""we are in a world filled with beauty. Every breath we breathe is the spirit of God within us. Around us is the love that moves the sun and all the stars. We are here because someone wanted us to be.""<br/><br/>Another aspect of the modern world, the 'selfie', prompts an insight inspired by Wordsworth's poem Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey. ""The self is too narrow a place to find meaning and satisfaction...the power of joy is that it momentarily silences the self so that we can see into ""the life of things"" and hear the music of the universe.""",
Judgement Day,b096gjdn,TRUE,1/10/2017,Shoshana Boyd Gelfand,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand reevaluates our use of the word judgemental, arguing that it needn't have negative connotations. She concludes that, ultimately, we need to be judged.<br/><br/>For some people of faith the phrase 'judgement day' summons up images of fire and brimstone. Shoshana reveals that for Jews, judgement day is an annual event. Yom HaDin, The Day of Judgement, is the biblical name for the holiday known as Rosh Hashanah. Shoshana explores the traditions of both Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (which follows ten days later).<br/><br/>Interweaving music ranging from Leonard Cohen's Who By Fire and Bob Marley's Judge Not to Mozart's Requiem Mass, Shoshana notes that the idea of a judgement day has always fascinated musicians. Interestingly, musical interpretations of the Day of Judgement vary wildly in tone. We hear the voices in Mozart's Requiem trembling with dread in response to a stern God, whilst Faure's Requiem does away with the wrathful imagery and depicts death as a peaceful release from struggle. Reflecting on the differences between these great composers' depiction of judgement day, Shoshana argues that we need a balance between judgement and mercy in our lives.<br/><br/>Shoshana goes on to reference the troubled history of the judicial system during the American Civil Rights Movement and the role of the therapist who must withhold their judgement when counselling their patients.

As wondrous as it is to see the arrival of speech in a child, there has long been a sense that children lose something as they try to contain their world in language.<br/><br/>Speech is one of the primary metaphors for God’s communication. Jane explores the extraordinary mixed metaphor of a Divine Language that becomes a human being and, even more strangely, a human being who has to learn to speak. The Word of God made wordless, a baby able only to cry and babble.<br/><br/>As a theologian it is Jane’s job - and her delight - to try to render our understanding of God in words.

He also suggests the qualities required of individual politicians in strengthening the legitimacy of a government - honesty and integrity, willingness to serve others rather than pursue their own ambitions, and courage to do what they believe in rather than what is popular.<br/><br/>Music by Billy Bragg written during the miners’ strike in the UK in the 1980s, as well as a remarkable historical account of popular resistance to heavy-handed military force in 19th century London, illustrate the point made by the author of The Right to Rule, Bruce Gilley, that, ""Rightful rule is rule that is consistent with the moral expectations of a political community.""<br/><br/>Or, as Rousseau would have it, ""The strongest is never strong enough to be the master unless he translates strength into right and obedience into duty.""",

Life in a Seminary,b01jqb8c,TRUE,10/6/2012,Mark Tully,Loftus,Hannah Marshall,"In Something Understood this week, Mark Tully is intrigued by life in a Roman Catholic seminary. How are young men trained for the priesthood?<br/><br/>At Allen Hall Seminary in the busy heart of London, Dean of Studies and Formation Advisor Father Stephen Wang explains the need for his students to train for their pastoral role within the Catholic community. Seminarians at Allen Hall spend much of their time in local parishes, schools and hospitals preparing for life as a Diocesan priest. And yet it's also crucial that they have the quiet, contemplative space they need to develop spiritually. They must become men of God and men of communion.<br/><br/>Mark explores the history of the seminary system, with readings from Anthony Kenny and Denis Meadows, and hears music written by ancient monks in isolation. He speaks to writer and academic John Cornwell, whose own time at Upholland Seminary in the 1950s left a strong imprint on his spiritual life. The Junior Seminary system he experienced from the age of 12 no longer exists, but John believes that there are still serious flaws in the way the Catholic Church trains its priests. He argues that seminarians are too separated out from the world and from the people they are destined to serve once ordained.<br/><br/>Ultimately, becoming a priest requires huge dedication - what Jesuit Father Pedro Arrupe described as a 'falling in love' with God. Perhaps what is also needed is a balance, between the prosaic and the spiritual, between being within the world and being apart from it.",

He discovers the benefits of education later in life, not just for the students but for society too.<br/><br/>Much of the programme is recorded in Oxford as Tully follows a rather unusual group of students as they enrol at the University's Bodleian Library. The ""Ransackers"" all missed out on education when they were younger, but they all have a passion for a research project of their own choosing. Now, they have been given the chance to pursue their interests by Ruskin College who pay all their costs for an intensive ten-week course of study.<br/><br/>In an interview with the Principal of Ruskin College, Audrey Mullender, Tully encounters the ideals of John Ruskin, the 19th century art critic, painter and educationalist. In those days when the class system was almost set in stone Ruskin believed that, through education, workers could achieve a vital sense of self-fulfilment.<br/><br/>And it's the 21st century passion for the benefits of self-fulfilment that Tully encounters when he meets the founder of the Ransackers, Vi Hughes. She speaks of the fear many older people have: fear of education, and fear that they are not capable of learning or contributing. Over nearly thirty years of tutoring at Ruskin, Vi Hughes has seen hundreds of lives transformed when those fears are overcome. Hughes is a champion of the idea that access to education for all, benefits the whole of society.<br/><br/>Tully also looks at other institutions such as the Open University and ponders if the ideal of education for education's sake can survive the modern emphasis on education to meet the needs of industry.<br/><br/>But the last word is left to the Ransackers, who describe the freedom they have found amongst the dreaming spires of Oxford.",

He explains that spirituality is often misperceived as venerating the past, or aspiring towards the future. While it’s important to do so, identity and meaning can also be found in the present.<br /><br />Harvey reads a prayer that imagines God reviewing the performance of every human being. The prayer has a simple and plaintive message: no-one knows whether they will be alive this time tomorrow, let alone further into the future. The importance of appreciating the present, then, becomes clear. According to legend, the prayer was written by Rabbi Amnon, who composed it as he lay dying, having been tortured for his refusal to abandon his faith.<br /><br />Rabbi Harvey also considers the relationship between living in the moment and caring for one’s self. While it’s important to be fully present for others, what’s more important, according to Harvey is to attend to one’s own needs. This in turn leads to being better at living in the moment for others.",

These figures hover in our past, unknown to us and yet not entirely distant. Although her ancestors are strangers, Sarah also feels close to them; she senses her place in a long lineage stretching back over the generations.<br /><br />As a teacher, Sarah is fascinated by another form of lineage, one through which knowledge is continually passed down. We hear from Jiu-Jitsu black belt Rener Gracie, whose family are martial arts royalty. The Gracies pioneered the stunningly effective Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighting system and have been honing it for generations, distilling it into an art form. Rener explains that, although he's only 34, he feels like he has over 100 years of martial arts expertise within him due to the compounding of knowledge across his lineage.<br /><br />For Rener, a braiding of lineage and family, memory and embodiment is expressed through a martial art. For others it's through the craft they practice or the instrument they play. Music has a powerful ability to strengthen the bonds within a lineage. Sarah draws upon the music of Toumani Diabate, a virtuoso player of the harp-like Kora, whose family have been Kora masters for 71 generations. She also explores the Jewish songs of the Seder, or Passover meal.<br /><br />Sarah concludes by explaining that religion itself can be thought of as a lineage, a ""chain of memory"" that connects past, present and future people of faith.",

Increasingly it seems, people are finding that making something for themselves, can be more enriching than just going to the shops. It's in step with our 'make do and mend times', but perhaps it's more profound than that.<br/><br/>Samira Ahmed reflects on how the impulse to make things with our hands is human instinct. The act of making demands concentration and can give time to reflect. Creating something handmade can bring deep satisfaction and a sense of achievement.<br/><br/>She considers the spiritual value of making by hand in Shaker communities and in monastic life.<br/><br/>And she hears stories of people for whom creating with their hands has particular significance, like the British World War II prisoner of war, who stitched subversive messages into his needlework samplers, right under the noses of his captors. Samira also visits the workshop of Eleanor Lakelin, who handcrafts bowls and objects from wood, and asks her about the meditative aspects of creating something by hand.<br/><br/>Featuring music by J S Bach, Alison Krauss and Billy Bragg and with the thoughts of writers including Pablo Neruda, Carl Honore and Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson.",

While he's unsure why man's best friend seems to crop up in his poetry so frequently, Michael knows he's not alone in finding dogs fascinating.<br/><br/>Dogs have featured in Egyptian sacred iconography, Old Testament and New Testament texts, and had lead or walk-on parts in countless poems, novels, films, paintings and songs ever since.

On the other hand, he looks at the damage that can be done if we are not bound by reasonable codes of conduct.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strongest defence of proper manners he comes across is that they are not for our own benefit or advancement but, rather, to help us consider the needs and feelings of others.<br/><br/>The readers are John McAndrew, Frank Stirling and Polly Frame.",

Mantras,m0000xmb,TRUE,28/10/2018,Jahnavi Harrison,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Musician Jahnavi Harrison examines the ancient practise of mantra recitation and charts the spread of mantras from their Eastern origins to Western pop-culture.<br /><br />The origin of the word ‘mantra’ lies in the ancient Sanskrit language. It means literally ‘mana’ or mind/heart and ‘tra’ to transport or transcend. In a religious context, Jahnavi explains, a mantra is a sacred sound formula - an arrangement of words with meaning, that have the power to connect the reciter with a specific spiritual goal. But the meaning need not necessarily be understood in order to have an effect, just as you don’t need to know about all the ingredients in cough syrup to feel it doing something.<br /><br />Om, believed by Hindus to be a 'primordial sacred sound' is perhaps the most well known of the traditional Eastern mantras. Jahnavi introduces us to an extraordinary recording of 10,000 people chanting Om as part of a project organised by the Rubin Museum of Art in Manhatten. We also hear the music of George Harrison which features this ancient chant.<br /><br />The belief of Hindus and Buddhists, that reciting mantras can transform the body and mind, are now the subject of much scientific study which has shown that regular chanting brings about changes within the brain. In addition to reaping the spiritual and cognitive benefits, Jahnavi explains that she chants daily in order to put on a suit of ""sonic armour"" that seems to protect her from the noise and intensity of the urban environment.",

He concludes, ""I'm evolving towards a position in which a secure relationship allows and encourages considerable space for individual growth. This is not purely to avoid smothering one's partner, but to nurture a healthy and mature relationship."" His journey of discovery is illustrated with readings from Alain de Botton, Khalil Gibran and Eric Fromm, along with the music of Billy Joel, Liszt and Brahms.",
May His Memory Be a Blessing,b04jhl50,,28/9/2014,Michael Zev Gordon,Falling Tree,Alan Hall,"Within the Jewish tradition, it's common to use the honorific 'may his memory be a blessing' when writing of the dead. The composer Michael Zev Gordon uses this phrase to reflect on the idea that so much of what we are is locked in memory, but that we only grasp this fully when it starts to slip away.<br/><br/>He draws on writings by Proust and W.G.Sebald, poems by Carol Ann Duffy and Marjorie Agosin, and musical excerpts from JS Bach, Thomas Ades, Robert Schumann, his own piano piece entitled 'On Memory' and the music hall song that was one of his father's last triggers to memory and identity, 'Daisy Bell'.",

From military trophies to reminders of our own mortality, he examines the objects we imbue with personal meaning.<br/><br/>Mark observes in the programme that mementos keep the past alive in the present and are preserved for the future - so they are important links through time.<br/><br/>Featuring literature from Joseph Conrad, W.B. Yeats and John Donne; and music by Nat King Cole, Arvo Part and the Band of the Blues and Royals, among others, the programme celebrates the comfort we can gain from inanimate artefacts, and the capability they possess to 'speak' across generations.<br/><br/>But Mark also observes that Mementos can be a trap, too, encouraging us to live too much in the past - to indulge our previous sorrows and losses.<br/><br/>Perhaps no institutions preserve their mementos more lovingly than the military, and the programme features an interview with military historian, Squadron Leader Rana Chhina who shows Mark his family mementos of campaigns in India and Pakistan - mementos which mean so much to him, his family and his comrades.<br/><br/>And Mark, himself, shares with us a memento which means much to him and which epitomises the power of mementos to bind us to each other and to the past, present and future.<br/><br/>Readers: Jonjo O'Neill and Adjoa Andoh",

In this episode of Something Understood, Remona argues that these tales profoundly impact our collective psyche, revealing the story of the human experience.<br/><br/>The poetry of John Keats and the words of the Quran remind Remona how metamorphosis can reveal our darker nature. Metamorphosis is a recurring theme in Hinduism too with Lord Krishna confiding in his warrior friend Arjuna, ""For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is dead, birth is certain.""<br/><br/>The episode features musical selections from Tchaikovsky and Van Morrison which underpin how metamorphosis can be part of life's purpose, moving away from stasis and encouraging reform, renewal and reflection.<br/><br/>The readers are Rachel Atkins, Laurence Kennedy and Max O'Brien.<br/><br/>Special thanks to Mandeep Moore for her Punjabi translation of Jind Kaur.",

For some it is a way of experiencing God, for others a means of coming to terms with their own failures, and for many it can produce profound changes in their lives.<br/><br/>As Mark Tully perceives, through the practice of Mindfulness people can drink from the well of religious insight whether they have a religious faith or not. He even accepts in the end that he should, perhaps, overcome his own reluctance to make the commitment that meditation requires, and curb the distractions that can make our minds rampage, 'like an untrained elephant'.<br/><br/>The readers are Emily Raymond and David Holt.",

For many, ethnic humour is inevitably racial humour and therefore automatically forbidden. But is it always as straightforward as that? With sociologist Christie Davies, Mark discusses how different nations form their own brand of jokes, how stereotypes emerge and how some groups become targets for humour.<br/><br/>Gilbert and Sullivan help us to laugh at those in authority, Daphne Du Maurier makes us squirm at the cruelty of a practical joke, and Mozart's Divertimento for Two Horns and String Quartet provides the punchline.",
Modern Architecture,b01hdplb,TRUE,13/5/2012,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Read by: Emma Fielding and Peter Guinness<br/><br/>Mark Tully ponders why the beauty he sees in the traditional architecture of his home city, New Delhi, is not apparent in the spate of modern buildings now being built. He despairs that the new can never match the magnificence of the old.<br/><br/>But to prevent himself sliding into a state of complete reminiscence and nostalgia, he spends a day with the world renowned Indian architect, Charles Correa, visiting inspiring new projects in the city. Correa, whose British Council Building in New Delhi is upheld as a masterpiece, shares Tully's dislike of inappropriate high rise blots on the Delhi skyline, but is more optimistic that a new form of Indian architecture will emerge, anchored firmly in the cultural and mythical traditions of the country. He sees Indian cities as a place of hope, and new buildings as a way of connecting the past to the future.<br/><br/>And with a warning to himself that he must not join the ranks of those who condemned the iconic Eiffel Tower and Sydney Opera House as monstrosities, just because they were different, Tully accepts that some change is for the good, as long as it's good to look at.",

On the other hand, words from Pope John Paul II about Poland, his home country's, struggle for independence from Soviet domination suggest a positive side to nationalism, if people search for what they have in common rather than stress what divides them.<br/><br/>And Mark talks with historian, Ananya Vajpeyi who concludes that that search should go deep into the past, and that India is an example to the world of how people of different religions, ethnicities and cultures can live side by side in one nation.<br/><br/>The presenter is Mark Tully.

It might be just a quick glance to check, ""Do I look OK in this jacket? Do I look as tired as I feel?"" Or a longer stare to assess the progress of the wrinkles around the eyes or emergence of grey in one's hair.<br/><br/>But sometimes we take a long look. Perhaps at times when we're disconcerted by life - apprehensive, frightened or ill. Then we ask questions like, ""Is this what the world sees when it sees me?

On the Edge,b011j39d,,29/5/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully considers those on the edge: of society, of the arts, of religions, and of perceived wisdom. People who don't quite belong, but who often offer us new insights.<br/><br/>Tully suggests that we have them to thank for much of the positive aspects of progress.<br/><br/>In the programme he says that, 'being on the edge is often represented as a chaotic state, opposed to an ordered one and, more profoundly, an uncertain state as opposed to a certain one. More profoundly because certainty can so easily be the barrier to change, development, and adapting to new knowledge.'<br/><br/>But being on the edge can be an uncomfortable place as poet and writer, Mamang Dai explains in an interview for the programme. She lives at the edge of India, in one of its remotest states, Arunachal Pradesh, set in the eastern Himalayas, with China just across the mountains, the Kingdom of Bhutan to the west, and Myanmar or Burma to the east. She not only lives on the edge of India geographically. There are 26 major tribes in Arunachal Pradesh and their cultures, which were protected by geography, by the State's remoteness and lack of communications, are now on the edge of modernity with India's development plans , in particular plans to build dams on the rivers which flow through the mountains. Mamang describes her fears for her homeland at a time of great change but is cheerfully optimistic that good things will come, and new ways of being will bring undreamt of benefits.<br/><br/>Franciscan Priest, Richard Rohr is quoted in the programme. He thinks being on the edge, or as he puts it, in a 'liminal place', is essential at times: 'Nothing good or creative emerges from business as usual. This is why much of the work of God is to get people into liminal space and to keep them there long enough, so they can learn something essential. It's the ultimate teachable space, maybe the only one.'<br/><br/>Tully himself, while nostalgic for what he feels was a more certain and ordered society in his younger days, recognizes that change, though often difficult at the time, has much to offer. Most of all, we owe a great deal to those - On the Edge.",

Nothing makes me want to cancel my life insurance like those smug inhabitants of magazine adverts and billboards, lying back in hammocks or staring out at the ocean, at peace with themselves because they have the right kind of insurance policy, or pension scheme, or investment fund.""<br/><br/>Such promotion, he argues, threatens the art of being fully alive in the here and now.<br/><br/>The bible he says is full of contradiction about peace. Isaiah 55 sets out a very loud and pretty alarming vision: 'You will go out in joy, and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills, will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.' Enough to tip an investor out of their hammock, however well insured they are.<br/><br/>Michael examines whether it's actually possible to find complete stillness and peace. He says, ""Even the two minute silence broadcast every year on 11th November is not completely silent, since it contains all the incipient and suppressed noise of people, breathing, coughing, shifting from foot to foot, a silence broken by the active effort to maintain it.""<br/><br/>We hear John Cage's 4'33"" as Michael tries to prove the impossibility of silence but, in the end, he says the best evocation of silence comes at the start of Dylan Thomas' play Under Milk Wood, famously read by Richard Burton, ""where Thomas describes the small town of Llaregyb just before dawn, before it is about to wake up.""",

He questions our assumptions about how physical ugliness might be linked to emotional or mental worth, and meets John Furse, film and television director and writer, who has suffered from a condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder since youth. This debilitating mental illness causes sufferers to focus obsessively on what they see as horrific defects in their appearance.<br/><br/>As Eustace-the-dragon hankers for transformation, John considers why real change is so hard and frightening for many of us, and how every new beginning is intrinsically bound up with something ending.

According to Sarah, we have much to gain by rekindling the playfulness of our early years.<br/><br/>Sarah draws upon her own experiences as a theatre practitioner to reveal the ways actors can incorporate playing to get over creative blockages, injecting a welcome dose of surprise, novelty, and fun into their work.<br/><br/>Brian Eno's ""Oblique Strategies"" are, according to Sarah, a fine example of how playful provocations can breathe life back into our creative endeavours when we're running low on ideas.<br/><br/>In the west, playing is all too often seen as a subversive distraction from ""serious work"" but Sarah explains that not all cultures understand play in the same way. In India play is intrinsic, fundamental and at the very heart of a divine universe. According to Hindus, the universe itself is a playful expression of the consciousness of God. Drawing upon the work of the philosopher Alan Watts, Sarah explains that when Hindus speak of the creation of the universe they call it the play of God not the work of God.<br/><br/>Sarah concludes by explaining that, for her, playing isn't something worthless and transitory but a way into leaps of unbounded imagination, experimentation, and joy.",
Poetic Rituals,b07tqs7b,TRUE,11/9/2016,Sarah Goldingay,TBI,Max O'Brien,"The commute to work, the weekly supermarket shop, brushing our teeth before bed. The routine and rituals of our everyday lives can often feel like dull repetition. But what if we could find a path to transcendence through these everyday acts?<br/><br/>Academic Dr Sarah Goldingay searches for what the liturgical reformer Rabbi Chaim Stern called the ritual poetry of our lives. Through this ritual poetry it’s possible, Sarah says, to experience a noetic moment - those profound instances when we experience the presence of the divine.<br/><br/>With the help of a diverse pool of writers and thinkers, Sarah argues that simple everyday routines can become powerfully spiritual - even making breakfast, as demonstrated in Sara Maitland's ecstatic experience when devouring her morning porridge. Through the writings of the Buddhist scholar DT Suzuki, Sarah discovers that simply sipping a cup of tea can also be a powerful zen moment.<br/><br/>The act of singing can transform everyday rituals into moments of transcendent beauty. Sarah samples the singing of Scottish herring girls and the haunting rhythms of a Mississippi prison gang, united in song as their pickaxes fall as one.<br/><br/>We might think that powerful spiritual experiences can only be experienced by the specially initiated. This programme suggests that perhaps, by noticing ourselves and the poetic potential of our own everyday rituals, the transcendent might just be closer than we think.",

Remona considers the unexpected strengths that can arise from positions of vulnerability.<br/><br/>She argues that occupying a position of weakness offers an opportunity from which we can learn from our mistakes, develop resilience, and nurture our faith. Those that wilfully occupy a lowly stance can often find unexpected strength - their humility can cause others' anger to cease. According to Remona, the weakest members of society can radically affect the attitudes of those around them.<br/><br/>Music from Bruce Springsteen and Stormzy contribute to Remona's exploration of weaknesses' hidden strengths.

And our reactions to them can be revealing. A joke played and taken in good part can be an affirmation of friendship. Many initiation rites have pranks at their core. Some religious teachers have used them to make a memorable point.<br/><br/>Yet a delicate balance has to be struck. There must be countless examples of pranks tipping over into cruelty, or friendships being ruined by a misplaced trick.

Prayer Before a Five Pound Note,b01k9m9z,TRUE,1/7/2012,Mark Tully,Loftus,Hannah Marshall,"Money occupies a central position in the lives of people around the world - no matter the culture or currency. And yet few of us ever pause in our earning and spending to consider what is it's real role within our society? What is its weight in our lives? In this edition of Something Understood, Mark Tully explores our human relationship with money and asks, given its immense power, what should be our Prayer Before a Five Pound Note?<br/><br/>We hear readings from a broad range of writers, with all sorts of view points on money, from Christian activist Monica Furlong to publishing magnate and poet Felix Dennis. Music includes Michael Head's exaltation of poverty, ""Money O!"" and JJ Cale's ""Money Talks"".<br/><br/>Mark speaks to Professor Jacob Needleman, who believes most people ignore the spiritual implication of money in their day to day lives, and do so at their peril. This is a strange attitude to take towards something which has such a singular power over us, as shown by Jacob's own experiments, in which he attempts to hand a five dollar bill to strangers in the streets. Their reactions, and his own feelings on giving away money in this way, reveal great deal about our often fraught interactions with it.<br/><br/>It seems that humanity teeters between the obsessive pursuit of money and often futile attempts to rid themselves of it. Perhaps the most productive way to engage with it is to abandon those two extremes and instead use it as a mirror to show us ourselves - the way we spend reveals our priorities in often surprising ways. Should our prayer before a five pound note be ""please, help me to understand myself""?",

You might curse your hesitation in these situations. But, Samira Ahmed asks: is procrastination always such a bad thing?<br/><br/>Most of us will have procrastinated at some point in our lives. Maybe you can't start the first sentence of the novel you've always want to write because you fear failure. Or perhaps you're putting off telling your partner that your relationship 'just isn't working anymore'. At worst procrastination can be debilitating or prolong a hurtful decision longer than necessary. But might it also be a useful tool for artistic inspiration and a way to let things happen in their own time?<br/><br/>Our relationship with procrastination is a complex one. Many of us are acutely aware that we are doing it, that it robs us of the time to complete tasks to the best of our potential, and yet we just can't stop it. Perhaps it is just human nature? Procrastination has often been characterised as a sin - leaving undone those things which we ought to have done - perhaps suggesting that procrastination has been a concern throughout history.<br/><br/>And yet, there may be something to be said for carefully considered delay. For anyone who's ever felt that sinking feeling after posting something in haste on social media, perhaps delaying action might have been prudent. We can learn from history that sometimes resisting pressure to act more quickly can prevent the direst of consequences. But deliberate procrastination by those who have the power to facilitate change or to maintain the status quo, even if it robs the powerless of equal rights, might suggest that procrastination is a luxury of those who have the time to wait.<br/><br/>The programme includes readings from Kurt Vonnegut, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lanchester, and W.H.

Rabindranath Tagore: Unity in Diversity,b012wckp,TRUE,31/7/2011,Mark Tully,Loftus,Jo Coombs,"For the 150th anniversary of the birth of visionary polymath Rabindranath Tagore, Mark Tully presents a special edition of Something Understood exploring Tagore's vision of the unity of all creation.<br/><br/>Tagore was a Nobel prize winning poet, author, musician artist and philosopher. He argued for the essential 'oneness' of humanity and aimed to heal the divisions between East and West, science and spirituality and man and nature. Mark Tully asks what we can learn from Tagore's belief that 'truth implies unity, a unity expressed through many and varied manifestations, a unity which, when we are able to realise it, gives us freedom'.<br/><br/>Mark speaks to Vandana Shiva, a philosopher, physicist, and globally renowned environmental campaigner, who explains her understanding of Tagore's concept of the universal.<br/><br/>We hear music from around the world - from sarode player Wajahat Khan to Purcell's 'Ode to St Cecelia'. And we learn that Gustav Holst immersed himself in Hindu mysticism and spirituality. His series of choral hymns from the Rig Veda, the oldest of the Hindu scriptures, was the outcome of that experience. Readings come from William Cullen Bryant - an American romantic poet inspired by the wildness of the forest, Jean-Paul Sartre and, of course, from Tagore himself.",
Rain,b01kr7nh,TRUE,15/7/2012,Mark Tully,Unique,Frank Stirling,"St. Swithun's day is arguably the most British of all Saints days, associated as it is with one of the nations most popular topics of conversation: the weather. More specifically of course, it's associated with rain as the saint is most commonly prayed to in times of drought and tradition has it that, if it rains on St Swithun's day, it will rain solidly for the next forty days.<br/><br/>Mark Tully considers the emotional impact rain has upon us in a summer that has already seen its fair share of it.

Mark discusses her approach to reading between the lines and the techniques she has learnt to help her interpret literary codes.<br/><br/>In the light of this, he considers the symbols and subtexts that exist all around us - through culture, literature and music, touching on the work of Alban Berg, Sergei Prokoviev and Barrington Pheloung and the writing of Queen Elizabeth I, World War Two cryptographer Leo Marks and poet Theodore Weiss.<br/><br/>The readers are Claire Vousden and Vincent Ebrahim.",

Can we be immobilised by self-pity at one extreme, but willfully insensitive at the other?<br/><br/>The programme features an interview with writer Erwin James, who served 20 years in prison for murder. He accepts that he will never stop regretting his crimes and seeks no forgiveness, rejecting the Christian notion of grace and a God who forgives sin. James does hope for some kind of eventual peace though, and explains how he deals with constant regret for the pain he has caused, by living the best life he can.<br/><br/>Mark Tully, with the help of Lady Macbeth and Edith Piaf, also looks at the opposite response to actions which have caused harm or distress - ""What’s done is done"" and ""Non, Je Ne Regret Rien"". He explores, too, the middle ground where our past actions are not so terrible that they must forever be regretted, but where we might also gain from acknowledging our shortcomings and the effect they have had on others.<br/><br/>Is it ever right just to ’forget about it’ and ‘move on’ or do we owe it to the people we have hurt to acknowledge our responsibility for their pain?",

He suggests that the earth builds us and we in turn shape the world; our actions leave a mark. This can have a profound effect on how we think of mind, body and soul.<br/><br/>The programme features the poetry of Derek Walcott who highlights how rooted we are to the earth, alongside readings from Guy Claxton which capture the wonder of having independent creative thought.

Restoration and Transformation,b084th9n,TRUE,11/12/2016,Sarah Goldingay,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Academic Sarah Goldingay examines the process of restoration. She discovers that restoring a broken or damaged item can have a transformative and spiritual impact on us.<br/><br/>To make do and mend is becoming a thing of the past as we slip into a cycle of consuming and quickly discarding our possessions. But Sarah argues the act of giving a damaged piece of clothing or a broken knick-knack a new lease of life by mending it is hugely rewarding. An intriguing example is the work of highly skilled audio restorer Andrew Rose, who digitally removes layers of noise ruining old and battered classical music records, revealing the beautiful music that was previously smothered in a fog of hiss.<br/><br/>The process of restoration can go beyond just returning a damaged object to its original state. It can inspire imagination and ingenuity. A broken or damaged thing can be a catalyst for creativity. Sarah takes us to Paraguay where we meet an internationally acclaimed youth orchestra who play instruments made out of rubbish. We also hear excerpts from William Basinski’s stunning Disintegration Loops, a classic ambient album made from ruined recordings of old compositions that had begun to decay.<br/><br/>Sarah concludes that mending and restoring are both hugely therapeutic. By mending broken objects we can also often mend ourselves.",
Reunions and Recognitions,b075mfc3,TRUE,3/4/2016,Rowan Williams,TBI,,"Dr Rowan Williams, Master of Magdalene College Cambridge and the former Archbishop of Canterbury, explores reunions and recognitions in the context of the Easter narratives.<br/><br/>The Sunday after Easter, traditionally known as Low Sunday, is a time when Christians reflect more deeply on the celebrations of the previous weekend. Rowan Williams describes the human story as full of creating, breaking and restoring relationships and illustrates his thinking with powerful moments of reconciliation in War and Peace when Natasha seeks forgiveness from Prince Andrei, and in King Lear where the King is revisited by his daughter, as well as with the reuniting of Jacob and Esau in Genesis.<br/><br/>It is this mending of brokenness that Dr Williams uses to link in to the Easter stories. ""They move us – and challenge us as well,"" he says, ""because they echo these deep feelings around finding and losing, separating and reuniting, recognising and failing to recognise and discovering that what seemed completely lost has not been destroyed. They are good news for us because they say that there is no relationship beyond mending in God’s providence and God’s time – that even the most final of separations or the most bitter of betrayals will not stifle the possibility of the reconciliation we long for.""<br/><br/>The programme also features the poetry of Wilfred Owen, as well as Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro where the unfaithful Count is forgiven by his wife, accompanied by music, which has been described as the sound of God absolving the world.",

Rhythm, it seems, not only sets our feet tapping, but binds us all in relationship with each other.<br/><br/>The programme features an interview with Russell Foster, the professor of Circadian Neuroscience at Oxford University. (Circadian referring to those rhythmic biological cycles that occur in us, within every 24 hours, such as the cycle of wakefulness and sleepiness). Professor Foster believes that, in our 24/7 society, we are trying to overpower that rhythmic cycle within us, with damaging and dangerous consequences to our health and the health of society. So why is rhythm so important, and why does it mean so much to so many people.<br/><br/>As Mark Tully says in the programme:<br/><br/>""We love Rhythm in music, we love it in poetry. Some discover it in prose too. Then we rejoice in the rhythm of the world we live in, the rhythm of each day, the rising and the setting of the sun, the rhythm of the seasons, and the rhythm that I particularly love, the rhythm of the sea - the tide ebbing and flowing.

The snake took this edict too far and was abused for its passivity. The Swami tells the snake, ""I told you not to bite, but I did not tell you not to hiss!""<br/><br/>Throughout the programme, Mark balances the dangers of misdirected or selfish anger with the need for anger as a means of challenging injustice and improving the lives of the disenfranchised.

From one of the great medieval love stories, he draws from the letters of Heloise castigating her lover Abelard for failing her, while insisting that still only he can be her rock. And he finds a metaphor for our very human tendency to mask our inner weakness with a show of outward strength in the extraordinary phenomenon that is a Prince Rupert's Drop - a tear-shaped drop of glass that can withstand the blows of a hammer to its bulbous end, but will explode into fragments at the slightest twist of its tail.<br/><br/>The programme features the song Anthem by Leonard Cohen, which includes the lyrics, ""There is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in"".

He draws comparisons with a host of other natural processes, where material enters in one form and is then converted into something new and life-giving.<br/><br/>Exploring topics ranging from Bible interpretation to composting, Malcolm draws on the words of American novelist Ann Pratchett and farmer and yoga teacher Jennifer Lynn to underpin his observations.<br/><br/>The process of fermentation is also explored as it has always been linked to Christianity's core ritual - Holy Communion. Both grain and grape are made new through fermentation. Malcolm argues that our ideas and beliefs work on our insides like yeast. Invisibly, we are leavened, we rise.<br/><br/>Malcolm concludes that, through rumination, we can access our darkest recesses in which an enormous source of energy for new life can be found.

Vrindavan is named after the goddess Vrinda who is said to take the form of the holy basil plant Tulasi in the worldly realm. Jahnavi reveals that this same plant is lovingly cultivated in the Hertfordshire temple where she grew up and is brought into the main shrine each day during the morning worship.<br/><br/>She goes on to explore the significance of the lotus flower, a key symbol in many Eastern religions.<br/><br/>The use of plants in worship is not confined to the East. The presence of Ocimum Basilicum - which many of us know as the basil we cook with - is a common sight in regional denominations of Orthodox Christianity, especially in the Greek church. Jahnavi explains that Orthodox Christians believe the herb sprung up where Jesus's blood fell near his tomb. Ever since, basil has been associated with the worship of the cross, particularly during Great Lent.<br/><br/>Drawing upon the Zen poetry of Matsuo Basho, Jahnavi discusses the lessons we can learn by paying close attention to the plants around us. Basho's vivid depictions of the plant world are complemented by the words of Sam Taylor Coleridge, whose poem To Nature is described by Jahnavi as ""a prayerful study of the plant kingdom"".",
"Sacred Sounds, Dangerous Women",b0bgw2m8,TRUE,9/9/2018,Remona Aly,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Journalist and broadcaster Remona Aly explores the turbulent relationship between Islam and the female singing voice.<br/><br/>Over the course of history, Islam has had a troubled relationship with music, with some believers arguing that it should be banned. Female singers have been particularly hard hit. Despite periods of repression that have seen Muslim women banned from singing in public and performing solo in front of men, there is a rich tradition of women using music to deepen their Islamic faith.<br/><br/>Remona interweaves the stunning tones of the ""queen of Sufi music"", Abida Parveen, with the young hijabi singer-songwriter Sevval Kayhan, who wowed the X-Factor Holland judges. We hear silken Quranic recitations from Indonesia alongside Olivia Newton John's rendition of one of Islam's oldest songs - Tala'al Badru 'Alayna.<br/><br/>In order to find out more about the current state of affairs in Britain, Remona speaks to Sakinah Lenoir and Rabiah Abdullah who together make up the acoustic duo Pearls of Islam. The band explain that they believe the negative reactions some have to the sound of the female singing voice is due to fear. Far from trying to revolutionise Islam, the pair explain that their work refers back to the time of Prophet Muhammad who surrounded himself with vocal women, female singers and poets. Following their interview, Pearls of Islam perform their beautiful track Mercy live.<br/><br/>Remona concludes that, while the controversy over female singers remains within certain quarters of her faith, these female singers are far from dangerous. For Remona, the real danger lies in stripping away an avenue of spiritual expression for women whose only aim is to reach out to the divine through music.",

Shoshana reveals that even the nightly ritual of saying goodnight to your children is laden with significance. She explains the Jewish bedtime ritual of saying the Shema - a prayer which is said to invoke the protection of angels.<br/> <br/>Shoshana also explores the linguistics of saying goodbye - from the French ""adieu"" which commends the receiver to god, to the German ""auf wiedersehen"" which literally means ""until we see again"". Describing her experiences as a hospital chaplain, she discusses the final days and weeks of life, a ""deeply scared"" time when ""this world and the next meet"".<br/> <br/>Shoshana concludes by arguing that, however painful parting may be, being aware that time spent together is limited makes it all the more precious.

Should saying sorry always lead to forgiveness?<br/><br/>From politicians to journalists, poets to criminals, and from entire countries to intimate lovers, Mark looks at those who have transgressed but cannot find it in themselves to acknowledge the fact and make amends. Just what benefits to individuals, races and nations would flow if an unwarranted act of war or aggression, or just simple inconsideration, was owned up to? What can we do to make the act of apology easier, and how should we respond to those who do manage to say that hardest word of all?<br/><br/>Who better than a politician to ask about the nature of heartfelt apologies, the ways we find to avoid them, and how we arrive at mealy-mouth substitutions. Mark speaks to Mani Shankar Aiyar, a member of India's ruling Congress Party and an expert on the political - with a small and large 'p' - apology. There are times, he admits, when an out-and-out admission of guilt, acceptance of responsibility and an unqualified and genuine apology is in order - but only when the game is up.<br/><br/>With music from Franz Liszt, Frank Sinatra and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and words by Somerset Maugham, Thomas Hardy, Desmond Tutu and Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mark considers the right and wrong time to seek redemption from those you have hurt, and the appropriate way to respond to the repentance of others who have done you wrong.<br/><br/>The readers are Peter Guinness, Emma Fielding and Frank Stirling.",

In fact, western culture tends to equate a desire for solitude with people who are lonely or anti-social, but there are many physical and psychological benefits to spending time alone.<br/><br/>Throughout time, seekers of all faith traditions have been drawn to solitude as a way of deepening their relationship with God. Remona offers the lives of the Prophet Muhammad and Imam al-Ghazali as leading examples of how seclusion can lead to overwhelming personal revelations and radical change in society.<br/><br/>The work of Beethoven is also examined as his phase of seclusion lead him to produce some of the most extraordinary symphonies of his career.<br/><br/>Remona also reflects on her own personal time of seclusion before dawn, leaving her bed to take part in a voluntary prayer known in Arabic as Tahajjud - a sacred time which she describes as therapy for the soul.",

This includes the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK Professor Manuel Hassassian who says for him, ""Mary symbolises hope, spirituality and love"".<br/><br/>Mary, who was a Jew and the mother of the Christian Son of God, is also one of the most revered women in the Muslim tradition. Known in Arabic as Maryam, a chapter of the Qur'an is named after her. Verses from the Quran relating to Mary are frequently inscribed on the mihrab, or niche within a wall of a mosque, denoting the direction of Mecca. But alongside this she is deeply human.<br/><br/>In Colm Tóibín's novel The Testament of Mary he examines the complexity of motherhood. Mary supposes herself to have intimacy with her son; she knows him better than he knows himself (she told him raising Lazarus was dangerous, he wouldn't listen). And yet, as she also acknowledges, he is destined to be at an impossible remove from her.<br/><br/>In 1968 the image of the Virgin Mary was seen above the dome of a Coptic Christian church in the Cairo suburb of Zeitun. The apparitions recurred for five months, for hours on end, and more than a million and a half people claim to have seen Mary during this time.

After losing a friend, Jo Fidgen goes in search of an afterlife that an atheist can believe in.<br/><br/>With readings from Czeslaw Milosz, Rainer Maria Rilke and Ali Smith; and music by David Lang, Karl Jenkins and Beethoven. The programme also includes an interview with a Sami reindeer herder about the tradition of bringing the dead to life in song.<br/><br/>Readers: Emma Fielding and Jonathan Keeble",
Self Portraits,m0001cy7,TRUE,2/12/2018,Michael Symmons Roberts,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"In this exploration of the self-portrait, the poet Michael Symmons Roberts starts with the modern phenomenon of the ubiquitous selfie and questions whether it really is such a quantum shift in the way we see ourselves in the world. Or is this just the latest tech-twist in the story of self-portraiture?<br /><br />""It’s become a cliché to mock and revile it,"" Michael says, ""characterising it as a narcissistic exercise, but the reality is more complex"".<br /><br />Self-portraiture goes way back to cave paintings, he suggests, and has a long and complex history. ""I still remember when I first saw one of Rembrandt’s self-portraits in the flesh, or LS Lowry’s red-eyed, searing vision of himself staring back. There’s something about them that makes us feel they are giving us the real person, a glimpse of the painter’s true self.""<br /><br />Michael goes on to extend his definition of the self-portrait from just painters and sculptors to include poets and novelists. The poetry of Nobel Prize winning Polish poet Wistawa Szymborska, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Emily Dickenson, and the music of Philip Glass, singer songwriter Don McLean and Nile Rogers, helps Michael conclude, ""Self-portraits, at their best, aspire to portray the inner world, not just the surface appearance.""",

John explains, ""exploring religious spaces, whether a local parish church, a simple village mosque or exuberant Hindu temple and watching the faithful in private prayer, or sharing in a service, I've been moved by this atmosphere of spirituality. I've always been intrigued as to how this sense of the sanctified can be physically built.""<br/><br/>In order to find out more, John visits St Paul's Cathedral with The Bishop of London Richard Chartres as his guide. He then walks a few miles to a very different sacred space - Brick Lane Mosque. The building that currently houses the Mosque has been a site of worship for over 200 years, having passed hands from the Huguenots to the Methodists and then on to East London's Jewish community before becoming a Mosque in 1970s. Celebrated architect Niall McLaughlin is on hand to unpick the layers of symbolism in the bricks and mortar and to reveal the secrets to designing a space that fosters stillness.<br/><br/>Readings include the amusing grumblings of Bishop Earle in the 17th Century and the work of the Cornish poet Nicholas Michell.

Set Them Free,b082vynm,,20/11/2016,Malcolm Doney,TBI,Jonathan O'Sullivan,"Writer and priest Malcolm Doney examines the importance of affording our loved ones the freedom they need to blossom.<br/><br/>For Malcolm, the hardest part of being a parent is to let his children go in order for them to fledge. From encouraging them to walk, to taking the stabilisers off their bike, it means allowing them to make mistakes, get hurt and ultimately learn from the process. Malcolm also looks at how having faith is really a matter of letting go. In conclusion, Malcolm argues that it is by letting go that we set ourselves free.<br/><br/>The programme features poems from Clare Pollard and A S J Tessimond which evoke the spirit of freedom, contrasted with readings from Carl Sagan who documents the human hunger for absolute certainty and Nina Simone who argues that true freedom is the absence of fear.",
Shadows,b07m4gby,TRUE,31/7/2016,Michael Symmons Roberts,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"The poet Michael Symmons Roberts looks in to the dark and under-appreciated world of shadows.<br/><br/>Most language which refers to understanding and happiness, tends to use images of light and sunshine. ""You don't hear much about 'flourishing' or 'rejoicing' in the shadows, only lurking, or hiding, or shrinking into them,"" suggests Michael. In this programme he makes the case that the metaphors for light and shade are too clear-cut and that their relationship is far more complex.<br/><br/>Shadows are often used to scare children in story books, or grown-ups in horror films. But Michael says shadows can be reassuring. ""If you can see your own shadow, it means you're not lying in it, as the dead tend to do.""<br/><br/>Turning to other cultures to illustrate his thoughts, he quotes Japanese author Junichiro Tanizaki and his work In Praise of Shadows which finds beauty in ill-lit spaces. Tanizaki is critical of the West and its ""quest for a brighter light never ceases, [which] spares no pains to eradicate even the minutest shadow.""<br/><br/>In Christian culture too - it's actually to those out of the spotlight that Jesus gives his richest blessings, the poor and the oppressed and the unsung heroes of the Beatitudes.<br/><br/>Using the music of John Tavener and Joni Mitchell and poetry from Keith Douglas, Derek Mahon and his own poem In Praise of Flaking Walls, Michael Symmons Roberts invites us to take another look into the shadows and to recognise that the relationship between light and dark is symbiotic with both of equal value. As he concludes, ""It's in the play between the two that culture, art, life emerges.""<br/><br/>Some of the ideas in this programme were previously explored by the author in a BBC Radio 3 interval talk in 2012.",

Bonhoeffer's open criticism of the regime in Germany in the 1930s was not echoed by his fellow pastors, and led to his imprisonment and execution by the Nazis before the end of the Second World War.<br/><br/>From the Pilgrim Fathers, who put the Atlantic Ocean between themselves and a State Religion they felt they could not be part of, to people faced with a choice when their church does not embrace their sexuality, or bars them from certain places or positions because of their gender, Mark Tully looks at those who have had to ask: Should I stay or Should I Go.<br/><br/>The readers are Grainne Keenan and John McAndrew.",

From jewellery to photographs, Malcolm argues that possessions can hold powerful spiritual resonances - they are repositories of memory and can act as signs or signals of our beliefs to others.<br/><br/>Items with a specific religious connection, such as a crucifix or a yarmulke, interest Malcolm because they're physical objects that link this world with another. He explains, ""these are physical, visible markers, but they fascinate me because they are also signs of something emotional or spiritual - invisible. Part of their significance is public, but part - perhaps most - is private. In fact, they're like icebergs, with the most of their meaning hidden, out of sight.""<br/><br/>Malcolm goes on to explore the power of holy relics, before turning to the question of whether focussing on physical objects in a religious setting results in idolatry.

Unless we are having trouble with sleep, as millions around the world do on a regular basis, it's a daily fact of life that we rarely consider.<br/><br/>John McCarthy explores the attractions and pitfalls of sleep and the ways in which writers and poets - from John Donne to Schopenhauer - have presented their ideas on sleep and dreams. Why does the reality of sleep make so many of them think about death?

Malcolm learns of the ‘slow movement’, an organised resistance to our culture of speed that spans several decades, driven by those producing ‘slow’ cinema, cooking and fashion. He examines the ‘slow art’ and ‘slow music’ of James Turrell, Brian Eno and Danny Hills.<br /><br />Waiting, doing nothing - although going against the norms of our culture - has its virtues, given that God doesn’t work to human beings’ impatient timetable or on demand. So how can we best slow down and be patient, especially during life’s more chaotic and stressful moments? Malcolm takes tips from Michael Palin on finding peace, and free-diver Kimi Werner on resisting panic.<br /><br />Malcolm concludes that slowing down allows us to place value on everyday moments, even small things like drinking tea, and encourages us to give slowness a go.",

He suggests that those who stress the importance of spirituality are also partly to blame for what he calls 'greed-based economics' because they have ignored our material needs. Maybe this, he feels, is one reason why economic thinking that ignores spirituality has such a grip on us that it seems to be the way of life.",

One is that there's ultimately no defence against human fragility - we can't postpone forever the acknowledgement that we are not all-powerful over the world. The other is the fact that the comfort we make for ourselves repeatedly blocks out the reality of other people's experience of fragility and risk.<br/><br/>Dr Williams argues, ""Unless we remember how much of a lie it is that we can make ourselves completely safe, we shall train ourselves not to notice how the majority in our world continue to live."" He explains that, at the heart of our experience of storms, is a religious revelation that there is no guarantee of safety but a promise that we shall be held through it all and not defeated.<br/><br/>According to Dr Williams, ""When we show ourselves ready to stand alongside those who face the worst upheavals, trials and pains, we reflect just a little of the steady presence at the root of everything that never disappears, the pulse that continues to beat even when we can hardly discern it - the presence we call God.""",

A thread is something we can follow, lose and pick up again. We might find ourselves hanging by a thread, or tying some loose ones together. They can bind us and we can break them. They are woven into our lives literally, metaphorically and linguistically.<br/><br/>The idea of following a thread to guide us is age-old, found for example in the Greek myth of Ariadne's thread leading Theseus out of the labyrinth, after he'd slain the Minotaur. Who doesn't need the thread of understanding to lead them through life's maze sometimes? Sacred threads play a significant role in the ceremonies of many faiths and cultures, not least in the life of the Guru Nanak and the founding of the Sikh faith. And when they are woven or knitted together, threads can play a potent role in art and domestic life.<br/><br/>Featuring music by Monteverdi, Bjork and Judy Collins, and writing by Robert Graves, Simon Armitage and Kate Summerscale.",

Rowan explains, ""From the Bible itself through the writings of the great contemplatives, there has been a constant stress on the mysteriousness of a God who can never be seen or touched like the objects of this world. Turn God into an object like others and you may as well forget about any serious religious depth.""<br /><br />Rowan draws upon the music of Purcell and Elgar and the poetry of George Herbert - and concludes, ""Like so much we hear and see in churches, images, sculptures, words and music can all be things that get in the way of what we’re there for… But they can also be invitations, reminding us that we come to sacred places in response to something we don’t always have words for, searching for a door or window that will let us receive more fully what the mystery that surrounds us wants to give.""",

It is the soul that carries us forward.<br/><br/>From the visions of an itinerant Baptist preacher and the reflections of James Baldwin, Abdul-Rehman looks to the urgency of understanding something of the mystery of death while we are alive. The world's most enduring mythologies and beliefs describe a supernatural drama and kind of unseen theatre.

The Fifth Element,b08q30lx,TRUE,14/5/2017,Sarah Goldingay,TBI,Max O'Brien,"Academic Dr Sarah Goldingay examines the elements and explores the spiritual significance of the idea of a 'fifth element' which appears in a wide range of faith traditions.<br/><br/>The four elements - earth, air, fire and water - were established in classical Greece in the west and are mirrored in the beliefs of many other ancient cultures around the world. These material elements are at the core of many creation myths. In Genesis, the spirit of God moves upon the face of the water, makes Adam from water and earth, uses wind to clear the land after the great flood and rains fire of destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah.<br/><br/>Sarah notes that, in most of the stories surrounding the four elements, there is another presence, an ethereal force that somehow blends and animates the material four - a fifth element.<br/><br/>Investigating this notion of a metaphysical power that transforms the physical and sparks creativity, Sarah draws upon biblical descriptions of the Holy Spirit, the writings of the first documented alchemist and the differing approaches to improvisation adopted by jazz legends John Coltrane and Keith Jarrett.",

She explains ""I kept hearing this pervasive sentence - 'Oh, but things are so much worse now, things are so much worse.' When I explored what was behind that, it was about changes in the climate - climate shocks, unpredictable weather - and then I realised that this was an issue of human rights.""<br/><br/>Mary explores the plight of the Marshall Islands, which sit only two metres above sea level. She draws upon the work of Marshall islander Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner whose poetry lays bare the effects of climate change on her place of birth.<br/><br/>Looking to the future, Mary argues ""we have to move away from business as usual. The industrial and technological revolutions, I believe, have to give way to an ecological revolution. This has to become everyone's agenda, to take part in this revolution.""",

The Good Old Days,b07wn3m9,,2/10/2016,John McCarthy,TBI,Max O'Brien,"John McCarthy looks back over the history of nostalgia, tracing the term back to the 17th century when a medical student coined it as a way of describing the bouts of homesickness the Swiss mercenaries were experiencing while fighting far from their native mountains.<br/><br/>In years past, treatment for nostalgia ranged from the application of leeches to being buried alive.<br/><br/>For John, far from being a disease, nostalgia is something that can be harnessed with beneficial results. Reflecting on his own time as a hostage in Lebanon, John explains that nostalgia can strengthen us, as long as it doesn't develop into a morbid obsession.<br/><br/>While homesickness and nostalgia might have plagued soldiers, they have always provided artists and composers with a powerful source of inspiration. Featured music includes Antonín Dvorák's Symphony Number 9 - From The New World, George Butterworth's setting of The Lads in their Hundreds and Robert Schumann's Kinderszenen. Poetry includes the work of John Masefield and Carol Ann Duffy.<br/><br/>John discovers that there is much to be gained from examining nostalgia through the lens of religion. The sermons of C S Lewis, the words of the Buddha and the research of Friar Dr Paul Witts who has studied the role of nostalgia in the life of the local church, all provide fertile material for contemplation. John also draws upon the works of Sigmund Freud and the 18th century British regimental surgeon Robert Hamilton.<br/><br/>John concludes that, while nostalgia certainly has a lot to offer, we shouldn't let it trump an enjoyment of the here now. After all, as the American band Eels so poignantly declare, these could be the good old days.",

The Greatest of These Is Love?,b01sd0hh,TRUE,12/5/2013,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Rosie Boulton,"John McCarthy is joined by writer Salley Vickers to reflect on the centrality of love in our lives, considering I Corinthians 13. This is sometimes referred to as the ""love chapter"" of the New Testament and is often read at weddings and funerals. Tony Blair read it at Princess Diana's funeral.<br/><br/>The chapter includes images and phrases which are known to us all, such as the invitation to ""put off childish things"" and the mystery of ""seeing through a glass darkly"".<br/><br/>Salley Vickers' first novel, Miss Garnett's Angel, became a phenomenal word-of-mouth hit and was followed by other greatly loved books, such as Mr Golightly's Holiday, The Other Side of You and Dancing Backwards. Salley has a skill at merging ancient art and modern psychology in her stories and often deals with Biblical matters. Her latest book The Cleaner of Chartres explores one of her best loved themes - the power of love to transform.<br/><br/>In this programme Salley considers I Corinthians 13 firstly as a piece of literature by examining how it works in terms of shape, tone, and images. She then brings her own experience to the chapter as both writer and psychotherapist. Questions arise as to whether it is true that ""love never faileth"" as the chapter says, what the value is of ""putting off childish things"", and whether it is always the case that love is greater that faith and hope.<br/><br/>The programme includes readings from Rumi, Viktor Frankl, Rilke and George Herbert, with music by Eric Whitacre, J.S Bach and Zbigniew Preisner.<br/><br/>Readers: Rachel Atkins and George Irving",

Michael explains that he ""can't help but associate it with longing, with yearning. ...because after all yearning, stirring, longing, well... that's what hearts do"".<br/><br/>With poetry from John Donne, Rita Dove and EE Cummings, and the music of Beethoven, Handel and the Ink Spots, Michael reflects on what it means to learn ""by heart"" and the power of a beating heart as a continual reminder of the physical and the incarnational. He concludes that ""whether it's concerned with our relationships with each other or with God, the metaphor of the heart is inescapable"".",
The Hidden 36,b06zqc25,TRUE,7/2/2016,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Emily Williams,"According to Jewish legend, in every generation there are 36 special people, called Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim, without whom the world could not continue to exist. Dispersed throughout the diaspora, they possess mystic powers which they can use to avert disaster. But their identities are unknown, even to each other. In fact, should a person claim to be one of the 36, that is proof that they are not one. The 36are simply too humble to believe that they are one of them.<br/><br/>Taking the example of the Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim as a starting point, John McCarthy explores how humility - an unpopular virtue in the age of individualism - can be a sign of strength and purpose.<br/><br/>Acknowledging the contribution of others, caring to the needs of young children or the sick, and being open to something larger than ourselves - humility is part of the human experience. True humility isn't stooping in order to look smaller than you are, it's standing next to something bigger than you which brings home to you your smallness. For the religious, that is God.<br/><br/>John is joined by the philosopher Oliver Leaman who reads from one of his f-vourite Yiddish folk tales, Bontsha the Silent. There are other readings from Last of the Just by Andre Schwarz-Bart, the poet Susanne Fitzpatrick, and C.S.

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem is believed to house the tomb in which Jesus Christ was buried and resurrected.<br/><br/>The Holy Sepulchre has been a site of pilgrimage since at least the 4th Century. Robin explains that, for Christians, a journey to the Sepulchre is a journey from geographical and spiritual peripheries to the very centre of the world.<br/><br/>Having been granted unrestricted access, Robin is led into the tomb of Christ itself by Archbishop Aristarchos Peristeris, a Greek Orthodox monk who describes the enduring power of sacred places to bring the believer closer to the divine.<br/><br/>Walking around the Holy Sepulchre's stunning rotunda, a vast dome flanked with columns, Robin takes in the various chapels and sacred spaces belonging to the six Christian denominations which all lay claim to the space. In the distance, pilgrims sing hushed hymns that echo off the polished marble.<br/><br/>The Holy Sepulchre offers an extraordinary sonic experience. In the Chapel of Calvary, believed to be the site of the crucifixion, Greek monks chant their prayers as thick clouds of insense fill the space. Meanwhile, in a chapel behind Jesus' tomb, a group of Coptic Christians sing during a communion service.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, we hear the great double doors of the Sepulchre close and the vast metal bolts lock. Standing in the courtyard, with the sun setting over Jerusalem, Robin notes that this daily ritual in which the monks are locked inside the Sepulchre is a powerful symbol of Jesus' own entombment, from which he rose.",

The Instinct for Meaning,b01lh968,TRUE,5/8/2012,Jake Arnott,Loftus,Jo Coombs,"Writer Jake Arnott believes narrative is a powerful force. In this week's Something Understood, he explores the idea that the instinct to create stories is innate within us all, and is vital to our understanding of the world and our own lives. After all, without a narrative to join everything together, our time on earth becomes little more than a series of random, unconnected events.<br/><br/>As a novelist, stories are Jake's stock in trade, it's his job to engage with them. But he thinks the desire to do so is universal - since our earliest evolution humans have been telling tales. Fairy stories in particular, passed down through an oral tradition, echo across time and across cultures. EM Forster described story as a 'low atavistic form'. Atavistic, yes, and deeply engrained, but Jake argues that Forster's insistence that story is mere causality is wrong. Story occurs without anything having had to happen, it's not just an order of events. Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' is a play in which nothing much happens, and yet it resonates with a powerful sense of story.<br/><br/>Jake speaks to Jane Davis, founder of The Reader Organisation. Jane's charity invites people to come together and read aloud, using narratives from books to engage with their own life stories. Through her work and her own personal experiences, she has found that stories can transform lives. And the telling of our own life story can be a powerful tool.<br/><br/>Readings from Jeanette Winterson and Joan Didion, and music including the Beatles' Eleanor Rigby and Schumann's Fairytale Pictures, help Jake to unravel the potent energy of narrative.",

And certainly, endings - and not just in literature - can become confused with a sense of where something started or the likelihood of various start points which suggest the possibility of more than one ending.<br/><br/>In this edition of Something Understood, Alan dances through ideas of what is retained, what is reawakened and what might be left behind when we approach an ending, with the help of writers - including O'Brien and Keith Douglas, Lydia Davis and Kazuo Ishiguro - and music that ranges from a late Schubert piano sonata, to Persian singer Aida Shahghasemi Beman's Stay, to The National's account of renewal after an end (Pink Rabbits) and Elly Stone's What I Loved.",

CS Lewis describes a very English type of friendship, reserved yet revealing - we can survive without it, Lewis writes, but life is so much better with it.<br/><br/>Running through the programme is a story by the 13th century Persian poet Farid ud-Din Attar about Shaykh Sanan, whose infatuation with a Christian girl has an enormous impact on his friends and disciples.

Breathing is also central to spiritual practices as in the traditional use of the Jesus prayer, ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God"" as we breathe in, and the second part, ""have mercy on me, a sinner"", as we breathe out"".<br/><br/>Through the poetry of Keats, Mark O'Brien and Denise Levertov and the music of The Hollies, Florence and the Machine and Puccini, Michael concludes that ""breathing is a delicate matter.

Within the palace, not even her husband, the King, realises she's a Jew. But when the anti-Semitic villain of the story, Haman, reveals his evil plot to murder all of the Jews, Esther is forced into a moment of reckoning.<br/><br/>Her uncle Mordecai challenges her to take off her metaphorical mask and reveal her true identity. Mordecai argues that her current disguise won't save her from destruction. He also suggests that there has been a higher purpose to her masquerade - the redemption of her people. Esther's bravery and leadership save the day. She reveals her Jewish identity to the King and the evil Haman's plot is foiled.<br/><br/>So, Purim has become Judaism's topsy-turvy day, when masks are worn, identities played with and the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred.<br/><br/>Shoshana explores the significance of masks during Venice's carnivals, where the frivolity of the celebrations belies the profound historical origins of the masks. She also draws upon Giuseppe Verdi's opera A Masked Ball, which shows masks to reveal much about the human condition.<br/><br/>Masks can be used to hide physical deformity, as is the case in The Phantom of the Opera. They can also take the non-physical form of what Carl Jung called the persona - a kind of mask used to ""conceal the true nature of the individual"".<br/><br/>Shoshana concludes that masks can be used to hide or reveal who we are, depending on how we use them.",

Don Paterson writes that ""Man is probably unique amongst the mammals in that he has conscious foreknowledge of his own death"".<br/><br/>One of the most powerful cultural influences on how we think about this subject is the poetry of Dante, whose epic poem The Divine Comedy imagined Hell as a physical place of torments nicely matched to the sins of its inhabitants.<br/><br/>One of the most troubling ideas found in Dante's afterlife is Limbo, a place of nothingness at the very edge of Hell for the unbaptised. It is an idea that has had a devastating impact on parents of stillborn babies in Roman Catholic countries like Ireland, where thousands of infants and stillborn babies were not allowed to be buried in holy ground and parents were taught to believe their dead children now dwelt out of the sight of God. It wasn't until 2007 that the Roman Catholic church offered hope that God would indeed save these unbaptised babies.

Michael explains, ""For a start, the temperature is different. If the moon is often characterised as cold, mysterious but ultimately dispassionate, untroubled by the vicissitudes of life on earth, then the stars have come to symbolise something like the opposite - they signal aspiration and hope, they shine, they bring you luck. They look down on you with promise, even with care. And they can guide you too.""<br/> <br/>Although science has taught us so much more about the stars, they are still a great mystery. For Michael, ""our knowledge of the sheer distance between us and the stars, the time it takes for their light to reach us, makes them unimaginably other, in both time and space. And it makes their light itself, the fact that we can see them at all, a relic and a mystery"".<br/> <br/>Michael reflects on a visit to the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank and reminds us that we are all aliens - made of stardust.

Although many Western traditions have often seen them as separate and distinct elements, the concept of the subtle body envisions them as deeply intertwined.<br /><br />Tracing the idea of the subtle body across multiple faiths and spiritual practices, from Hinduism and Buddhism to the mystical Jewish Kabbalah tradition, Sarah asks what it can teach us about the mysteries of the soul. Along the way, she examines some of the ways that poets, musicians and thinkers have explored the relationship between the corporeal and the spiritual. The programme features the poetry of Emily Dickinson, the jazz of Alice Coltrane and Beethoven’s symphonies.<br /><br />Sarah argues that the concept of the subtle body has not only been used to understand the deep connection between the body and the spark of life that animates it, but also as a way of forging a connection to other people and the world around us.",

Samira Ahmed explores the ways adolescence can resonate in later life, and reflects on staying in touch with one’s inner teen.<br/><br/>Teenage years are for trying out different versions of our selves - dipping a toe into adulthood, as childish things are put away. It’s the time for dreaming of the limitless possibilities life might bring, while being simultaneously daunted by them.<br/><br/>Samira is joined by Alom Shaha who grew up on a tough South London council estate in a strict Bangladeshi Muslim family. After his mother died, Alom, aged just thirteen, took responsibility for his younger siblings. Now a science teacher, he wrote The Young Atheist's Handbook, to help other teenagers who decide to leave the faith they were raised in.<br/><br/>All that angst and passion - the teenage spirit - where does it go? Does it still glimmer within or does it dissipate with adulthood?

Shoshana notes that, while modern scientists theorise that time was created alongside the universe during the Big Bang, a similar claim was made centuries before in the Bible. Scripture doesn't state this explicitly, but the Bible uses the same Hebrew word, ""olam"", to describe both time and space - suggesting linguistically that they are similar phenomena. In general, ""olam"" refers to the physical universe, but it also can mean ""forever"" or ""eternity."" Shoshana explains that, whether one believes that the world was created through Divine Speech or a Big Bang, both science and the Bible agree that time and space are one.<br/><br/>For Shoshana, Joni Mitchell's Circle Game offers us valuable insight into the circular patterns that appear with the passage of time, while Gilbert and Sullivan playfully note the failings of our attempt to number our days using the Gregorian calendar.

The Two Sides of Hope,b010xy2p,,8/5/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"We think of hope as such a positive thing but Mark Tully considers the dangers of false optimism, and the despair that can follow the collapse of great expectations.<br/><br/>He takes two examples.<br/><br/>On New Year's Eve 1918, the ship, the Lolaire (Pro: You Lair Uh) was bringing over 300 survivors of the First World War back to their loved ones on the Hebridean Island of Lewis and Harris. This return was one of great hope - for those returning, for those waiting, for the Island, and for the world after such a catastrophic war which had ended just six weeks before.<br/><br/>The following day would be a New Year. But in the small hours the ship was caught in a storm as it approached the harbour and sank within sight of the crowds on the shore. Most were drowned. It seems the amount of despair is sometimes exponentially linked to the amount of positive expectation.<br/><br/>And Mark Tully also looks at a contemporary story of infertility, where regular hope is followed by regular despair, and there can often be a desire not to hope, at all, for fear of the disappointment that follows.<br/><br/>But it's not all doom and gloom. Mark Tully also looks at how enduring hope can be a respite, and one that can be continually reached. And the words of Martin Luther King, and the music of Frank Sinatra add another positive note in favour of Dreams, and High Hopes.",

He draws upon the popularity of Roald Dahl's Tales Of The Unexpected to demonstrate our unspoken yearning for the surprising.<br/> <br/>He also explores the kindness and joy that can lie within applications of the unexpected. He uses Jack Riemer's story of a rabbi receiving the same good news from multiple well-wishers, in order to examine the positive side of the surprising. He also reads one of Shakespeare's most famous verses from Twelfth Night, to explore the way the unexpected can imbue individuals with greatness, despite it being thrust upon them.<br/> <br/>In conclusion, Rabbi Harvey considers the way the unexpected can be perceived as a divine steer, and resolves to seize upon the surprising in order to channel it in the best way possible.",

At Horfield Church in Bristol, where Jenny is buried, they talk about her struggle with this cataclysmic event - the shock, the loss of her priestly vocation and the search for reconciliation.<br/><br/>Julie says: ""Jennifer was a vibrant, joyous human being, a 24 year old young woman on the cusp of fully adult life. At the time of her death Jenny lived with her partner in Reading, had recently completed a Masters in music and worked for a music publishing company in London. She had so much to look forward to. Jenny's death and circumstance of her death will always contain elements of the unresolved, how could it not? So much was lost. The unresolved is a reality I live with and within that state attempt to live well. Jenny's passion for learning and her love of music and literature is reflected in a charitable trust established in her name. Jenny is gone but her name and the essence of her continue to make a difference and to inspire others."" Julie Nicholson's book about her daughter, ""A Song for Jenny"" tells the story of her loss and grief.<br/><br/>The programme includes poetry from George Herbert, Rainer Maria Rilke and Carol Ann Duffy and music from Christian Forshaw and Charles Ives.<br/><br/>Perhaps that which seems to bankrupt us at the time, leaving us naked and numb, is not necessarily the final reckoning?",

In it, life is potential - but so is death. It has to be restrained, held back by divine initiative, to make space for human life, and the threat of the return of the waters to inundate the land is ever-present.""<br/><br/>Jane considers some of the paradoxes of water and illustrates her narrative with poetry from Emily Dickinson and Matthew Arnold, along with readings from CS Lewis and Jules Verne. She also uses music to capture the different aspects of water and how we experience it. Compositions from Wagner and Toshiro Mayuzumi add to her thinking, with John Ireland's setting of John Masefield's poem Sea Fever.<br/><br/>For Christians, water is significant in the ritual of baptism which itself symbolises death and resurrection, the heart of the Christian faith. Jane concludes, ""I suppose this exploration of the water that is both creation and destruction, chaos and peace, turns out to be a plea for hope. Not a naïve optimism that everything is all right really, but a kind of reckless trust that says, since we cannot control life and death, beginnings and endings, any more than we can in the end control the seas' tides, let us choose an adventure of trust rather than a life of fear.""",
The White North Has Thy Bones,b04wrwly,,4/1/2015,Samira Ahmed,Whistledown,Kevin Dawson,"Samira Ahmed reaches for the far North, exploring how it has been perceived, dreamed and even desired. Why is there such enchantment for these snowy wastes, where death awaits so many?<br/><br/>She considers the Arctic obsession of the 19th century, where society clamoured for news of great explorers like Franklin and swooned at thoughts of their fate. Tales of being frozen solid, cannibalism and insanity.<br/><br/>Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote a short poem for the memorial to Franklin which stands in Westminster Abbey, ""Not here: The white north has thy bones; and thou, heroic sailor soul, art passing on thine happier voyage now towards no earthly pole.""<br/><br/>But this is not simply the land of explorers. Samira hears from the people who inhabit the apparently uninhabitable. There's the Inuit. What is their relationship with the environment and the creatures they share it with?<br/><br/>Beneath the ice flows lie submarines, fearful, lying in the dark. What of the men who live beneath these freezing waters, and what of life in the Soviet labour camps of Siberia?<br/><br/>With music from contemporary composer Gavin Bryars, and readings from Jules Verne and Philip Larkin, this is a journey into the far north - which represents a sublime paradise for many and, for so many others, a hell.",

The Wisdom of Equality,m0002g33,TRUE,10/2/2019,Suryagupta Dharmacharini,TBI,Oliver Seymour,"Chair of the London Buddhist Centre Suryagupta Dharmacharini considers what is meant by the concept of equality and how to achieve it. She explores the process of confronting both internal and external biases.<br /><br />Suryagupta considers her own experience of growing up as an African Caribbean girl in the UK and the sense of inferiority that often accompanied that. She turns to Buddhist teachings in an attempt to counter this state of mind, in favour of creating a more equal and loving experience. However, she remains mindful that religions can sometimes choose to focus solely on individual freedom, rather than taking a wider stance against inequality caused by society’s flaws.<br /><br />Keeping socially sanctioned inequality in mind, Suryagupta looks back on a recent trip to South Africa. Although apartheid ended 25 years ago, discrimination is still rife. She argues that this disparity means a sense of freedom is absent for both white and black South Africans – armed guards and barbed wire characterising Cape Town’s rich suburbs.<br /><br />Suryagupta concludes her exploration of equality by considering the importance of reflecting on biases, to actively pursue a freedom that is only reached by finding common humanity. In finding this, she explains, we can achieve a richer, truer experience of humanity.",

Charles Darwin wrote, ""The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature.""<br/><br/>The programme takes us from the mining mules of America to the intrepid mule trains on the borders between Pakistan and Afghanistan, from the Old Testament to Greek myth. Mark also talks to those who commemorate the heroism of mules in two world wars every year and to Dr Faith Burden of the Donkey Sanctuary.<br/><br/>There are readings from the medieval poet Hafiz and twentieth century writer Cicely Fox Smith and music from the Grand Canyon and from Mexico.<br/><br/>The readers are Emily Raymond and Jasper Britton",

She discusses the use within the Jewish home of the Mizrach - a piece of art that hangs on a wall allowing the inhabitants to orient themselves towards Jerusalem. She explains that this orientation to a spiritual home is a kind of internal map, ""a way of positioning ourselves so that we feel rooted wherever we may be"".<br/><br/>Exploring the concept of ""returning home"" in a musical sense, in which a composer skilfully resolves a chord sequence in a way that sounds uniquely satisfying and conclusive, Shoshana draws upon the music of Chopin and Schumann. These pieces sit along musical celebrations of the home from Crosby, Stills and Nash, bluesman Blind Willie McTell and Simon and Garfunkel.<br/><br/>Shoshana describes the centrality of the home to the Jews, whose rituals are mostly performed at home rather than at the synagogue, before concluding that, for her, home is ultimately defined by the people she holds dear rather than any one fixed location.",

This Is My Vigil,b01np0zy,TRUE,4/11/2012,Mark Tully,Loftus,Jo Coombs,"There are many different types of vigils; from waiting at the bedside of a loved one who is ill or dying, to peacefully praying for peace in a conflict. Sometimes we choose to keep vigils, but sometimes they are thrust upon us - like waiting for someone to return from being in danger. In this edition of Something Understood, Mark Tully asks why people hold and participate in vigils.<br/><br/>Mark Tully speaks to Dr Shelia Cassidy, who believes that vigil is part of the very fabric of life. Her own life has been full of vigil. We hear about her most important personal experience, when she was in jail in Chile and threatened with execution or life imprisonment. That night she stayed awake, arguing with God. She explains how, in this personal vigil, she tried to abandon herself to the will of God - like Jacob wrestling with the angel.<br/><br/>A pioneer of the hospice movement and of palliative medicine, Dr Sheila Cassidy has also helped many people to keep vigil as they die. She explains that she has learned we all have to keep vigils during our lives.<br/><br/>Sheila also sees prayer in general as a type of vigil; it's a time to leave one's mind open to whatever comes, and to wait for God.<br/><br/>With readings from Rabindranath Tagore on patience and Christopher Reid on the vigil he held at his dying wife's bedside, and music from John Tavener and Joan Baez, Mark Tully explores what role hopeful ""watching and waiting"" can play in our lives.<br/><br/>The readers are Gareth Armstrong, Emily Bevan and Simon Tcherniak.",

Through a Glass Darkly,b08skrxf,TRUE,4/6/2017,Michael Symmons Roberts,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"The poet Michael Symmons Roberts looks in to the mirror for insight and revelation, reckoning and resolution and discovers the beguiling world through the looking glass.<br/><br/>Central to his thoughts are the famous words of St Paul from 1 Corinthians 13 - ""For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known,"" - which tantalisingly suggest that what we see now is only a partial vision of reality. In this world, a glimpse is all we get.<br/><br/>""Many parents will remember the time,"" Michael says, ""usually around 18 months old, when a child first recognises that the baby in the mirror is not a sudden visitor. It's you!"" This moment of self recognition (only shared with four kinds of ape, Asian elephants, bottlenose dolphins and, perhaps surprisingly, magpies) allows us all into the unsettling mixture of bare fact and mystery that confronts us in the mirror. Michael explains that, ""The truth offered by such surfaces is fugitive, deceptive, elusive.""<br/><br/>Through the music of Icelandic singer Bjork, Michael Jackson, Roxanna Panufnik and Philip Glass, and the poetry of George Herbert, Denise Levertov, John Ashbery and Carolyn Kizer, Michael takes us through the looking glass to a wonderland of paradox and possibilities. He says, ""The reflective surfaces of glass or water offer visions of a different world, potentially treacherous or unknown, but a world you can enter physically if you dive into the lake, or visually if you allow your gaze to pass through it.""",
Tigerish Waters,b05v6ght,,17/5/2015,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Natalie Steed,"John McCarthy considers the way that we can accommodate ambiguity and complexity.<br/><br/>The title of the programme comes from Louis MacNeice's poem ""Entirely"" which explores the way in which it is never possible to be ""entirely"" sure, or to have fully grasped a meaning, or to fully be in a moment.<br/><br/>Take a walk in an urban woodland: you can seek and find a sense of solitude whilst always being aware of the busy-ness around you and be aware, simultaneously, of the beauty of birdsong and the trundle of road traffic beyond the gates.<br/><br/>We hear from poets and writers who have explored not getting things ""entirely"" and found a kind of pleasure and peace in that acceptance. There are readings from Louise MacNeice, Kathleen Jamie and Michael Longley, and an interview with Tom Bolton who writes about London's secret rivers and lost neighbourhoods.

To Fashion,b01gnhrt,,29/4/2012,Irma Kurtz,Unique,Ronni Davis,"In 'To Fashion' Irma Kurtz explores the notion that the garments we wear are a costume of choice. Once beyond the nursery, modesty orders us to cloak our skins, and sometimes our heads and faces too. To wear strategic covering in public is required practically everywhere by law as well as modesty. But we dress for more reasons than modesty and protection. The garments we choose are our costume, and sometimes a uniform, too. What we wear displays if not precisely where we originate and who we are, certainly who we wish we were and want to be seen as being.<br/><br/>To illustrate this theme we hear readings from Robert Herrick, Sebastian Horsley and P.G. Wodehouse. The music is by Sergei Prokoviev, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin and Paul Durand. The readers are Liza Sadovy, Col Farrell and Frank Stirling.",

"Touch Me, Touch Me Not",b01946p3,,8/1/2012,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully considers our sense of touch and how we take it for granted. Somehow our other senses seem more active, even more important to us. We might fear the loss of our sight, or our hearing, but seldom do we worry about losing the ability to touch. But how would we cope without being able to feel anything through our skin? Or, indeed, how would we function if we could not feel our limbs? Tully relates the case of Ian Waterman who had to face life without the sense of touch when he lost all sensation below the neck at the age of nineteen.<br/><br/>He also looks at different cultural attitudes to touch, from the reserved Anglo-Saxon handshake to the more ""touchy-feely"" ways of greeting in Latin countries. What do our ways of touching, or not touching, say about us?<br/><br/>The programme also considers the notion of inappropriate touch, but at the same time explores the dangers of avoiding touch for fear of being accused of wrong-doing. Tully quotes from author, Judy Rigby, who maintains: ""All too often, when we hear about touch, it's in the context of pornography, abuse and violence ... we are afraid of touching because our actions might be misinterpreted. Hence children are deprived of appropriate touch at a very early age. Our response has been analogous to that of a person, who having eaten some bad food, decides that the best course of action in the future is not to eat at all, rather than ensuring what is eaten is healthy.""<br/><br/>With poetry from John Betjemen and Michael Ondaatje; and music from Irving Berlin, John Dowland and Rachmaninov, Mark Tully wonders at the seeming simplicity of touch, but its power to transmit and transform. And he celebrates the fact that we need to go on touching if we are to go on caring.",
Towards a New Consciousness,b01qdpcy,,3/2/2013,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully explores how a new way of thinking about spirituality might change our attitude to the environment. By looking at modern and historical ideas about the relationship between the cosmos and God, he encounters an emerging theology which brings science and religion together, and claims to make possible a new level of consciousness.<br/><br/>He discovers how this ecological spirituality might have profound ethical implications for us as we struggle to develop ways of protecting our planet. The programme also considers how this green theology might reconcile both the sacred and scientific stories of evolution.<br/><br/>Drawing from a diverse selection of music, from Gustav Holst to Joni Mitchell, and readings from Margaret Atwood and the Indian philosopher Sri Aurobindo, Mark Tully describes the development of a theology and philosophy that hopes to meet the challenges posed by the crisis our natural world faces.",

Transformation,b03g8d5y,,3/11/2013,Mark Tully,Unique,Adam Fowler,"Mark Tully draws on Russian music and folk stories to ask why the age-old theme of transformation continues to hold such fascination for us.<br/><br/>He begins with a prince forced to marry a frog who, not surprisingly, turns into a beautiful princess before changing once more, this time into a swan which flies off leaving the prince distraught. Of course things work out just fine for the prince in the end, and Mark suggests that one reason we are constantly intrigued by the possibility of transformation is simply that we yearn for a change for the better.<br/><br/>Whether personal, religious or political, the attraction and the dangers of transformation are explored through the music of Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Mahler and Marley - as well as readings from Alexander Afanasyev, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Edmund Spenser and Carol Ann Duffy.<br/><br/>True to the archetypal story of transformation, the programme ends happily ever after. But will our presenter will turn into a handsome prince?",
Transience,b03zxmyc,TRUE,6/4/2014,Samira Ahmed,Whistledown,Anthony Denselow,"How should we deal with the idea of transience - in our daily lives and in the natural world around us?<br/><br/>Should the fact that everything and everybody we hold dear (including ourselves) is impermanent and passing worry us? Or should we ignore the idea of transience and get along without considering the constant turmoil of change in both the mundane world of the everyday and in the wider cosmos?<br/><br/>Samira Ahmed explores the role of transience in our lives. She looks at the various ways in which transience pops up beyond the obvious cycles of birth, death and short-lived lives. She considers the understanding of science and examines the transience of memory and its play within the rapidly achieved stages of life.<br/><br/>Samira also looks at the effects of transience on the world we have constructed so solidly around us - describing the transience of a city she has got to know well, Berlin, as it undergoes yet another transformation.<br/><br/>And how central is an appreciation of transience to any spiritual understanding? She looks at both the Christian and Hindu traditions to see how they express ideas of impermanence. With music, poetry, and extracts from key thinkers on the subject throughout history, she considers how we might best cope with this potentially distressing reality.",

Trial and Error,b0bbn6lx,TRUE,22/7/2018,Malcolm Doney,TBI,Jonathan O'Sullivan,"Writer and priest Malcolm Doney examines the process of trial and error. He believes it's at the very root of how we find out about the world, how we mature, form relationships, and develop philosophies and religious beliefs.<br/><br/>Although some theologians from different traditions disagree on its meaning, it can be argued that the spirit of experimentation can be seen in the biblical book of Genesis when Adam and Eve taste the forbidden fruit.<br/><br/>Malcolm also considers the process of trial and error in the arts, examining the experimental work of artists, writers and musicians like the composer Terry Reily. These artists push the barriers in their work and appear to be driven by the need to discover something new.<br/><br/>Trial and error is also at the very heart of the scientific method, a process which originated in the 17th Century. Malcolm observes that testing must be rigorous, a belief held by one of the fathers of the scientific method, Ibd al-Haythem, who said, ""man must make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and attack it from every side."" Malcolm notes that, while proof is hard to come by in maths and science, it’s even less obvious in the areas of philosophy, spirituality and religion.<br/><br/>Malcolm deduces that living experimentally is an exercise in faith. There is research, calculation, observation - and, out of all that, a theory is formed. He concludes that when people practice trial and error in their own lives it has to be something they have faith in - otherwise why would they invest their energy?",

Uncertainty,b0b5qn14,TRUE,10/6/2018,Harvey Belovski,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"Rabbi Harvey Belovski goes back to his childhood and remembers the nervous boy who had an aversion to uncertainty - something that continued to trouble him well into adulthood.<br/><br/>Harvey explains that, when he was young, he was taken with the certainty shown by Abraham in the story of the Binding of Issac, where his total faith in God led him to the brink of sacrificing his son. According to Harvey, ""we are always left in awe, or horror, that Abraham seemed to experience no doubt that he was doing the right thing.""<br/><br/>Later, Harvey found another interpretation of the story in the writings of a Polish rabbi known as the Ishbitzer, who suggests that Abraham was being tested to see if he could embrace uncertainty - did God want Abraham to sacrifice Isaac or would Isaac become the father of a great nation? Abraham simply couldn't know, yet he was required to accept the doubt.<br/><br/>""This might seem trivial,"" Harvey says, ""but it changed my world forever...I began to see doubt and complexity less as enemies to be eliminated, but as central features of a meaningful life.""<br/><br/>Through traditional Jewish music and the compositions of Mozart and Chopin, he leads us on his journey from discomfort to mature acceptance that uncertainty is something to be embraced.",

Walking and the Mind,b03m3kqr,TRUE,22/12/2013,John McCarthy,Whistledown,Anthony Denselow,"John McCarthy explores the effects of walking on the mind - on our creative and spiritual well-being.<br/><br/>We all know that a good walk is physically good for us, but we rarely stop to consider its impact on our mental states. Was Friedrich Nietzsche right when he said, ""all truly great thoughts are conceived by walking""?<br/><br/>Walking, especially walking in countryside, has been important to many creative artists and writers. Beethoven, Erik Satie and Benjamin Britten all used their daily walks for inspiration, as did William Wordsworth as he tramped the paths of the Lake District with his sister Dorothy.<br/><br/>John McCarthy looks at the act of walking as inspiration and also considers its spiritual function. Why do so many people, from a wide variety of religious beliefs, walk to display their devotion and increase their spiritual understanding? Around the world, millions set out each year along the great pilgrimage routes, and often travel on foot.<br/><br/>John McCarthy talks to the British artist Richard Long, whose work often describes walks he has undertaken or imagined. He also talks to Colin Thubron - one of our finest writers about discovery and place - who recently made the arduous journey on foot around Mount Kailash in Tibet, sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists.",
Walking Backwards to God,b015msnv,,9/10/2011,Mark Tully,Unique,Frank Stirling,"""We advance to the truth by experience of error; we succeed through failures - we walk to heaven backward."" The words of Cardinal Newman, academic and leader of the Oxford Movement, provide the starting point for this edition of Something Understood, in which Mark Tully asks how best we should learn from our mistakes.<br/><br/>""Make a mistake learn from it and move on"" is common advice, but what does that actually mean? When do we stop making mistakes - and should we be actively trying to make them? Newman's assertion is tested in conversation with the writer Canon Stephen Cherry from Durham Cathedral and with the help of literary work by Robbie Burns and James Fenton and musical works by Frank Loesser, Shirley MacLaine and the Choir of Kings College, Cambridge.<br/><br/>The readers are Adjoa Andoh and Alistair McGowan.",
Walls,b08k19gl,TRUE,26/3/2017,Michael Symmons Roberts,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"Michael Symmons Roberts asks whether walls are a liability or asset. ""They come with such metaphorical power,"" he says as he reflects on their role in music and poetry.<br/><br/>Walls tend to be seen as divisive and things only get better when they have been knocked down - the destruction of the Berlin Wall symbolised the end of the Cold War and inspired a generation. But Michael contends that walls and partitions are not all bad. They make good neighbours according to Robert Frost, they can be beautiful when decorated and people have even been known to marry them.<br/><br/>According to Michael Roberts, separated by our walls, we are mysterious to each other, infuriating, frightening, enticing. Poets and filmmakers and novelists make great dramatic use of them to explore how we can be proximate and separate at the same time, and the tensions and mysteries that can create.<br/><br/>Through the music of David Bowie and Bach, the poetry of Stevie Smith and Laura Kasischke, Michael finds many contrasts in our attitude to walls and concludes that their role is paradoxical. As Simone Weil explains, ""The world is the closed door. It is a barrier. And at the same time it is the way through...Every separation is a link.""",

And she explores depictions of warrior women in fiction and popular culture, looking at the battle cries of Beyonce, Dr Who’s first female regeneration, the children’s cartoon Burqa Avenger and the all-female Dora Milaje tribe from the box office hit Black Panther.<br /> <br />Throughout, Remona works to redefine warrior-hood, showing this fighting spirit is not only found in men in the midst of warfare, but in the resilience of a mother in labour, in the fight of a shero against misogyny, and in the very essence of womanhood.",
Watching the River Flow,b0848m18,TRUE,4/12/2016,John McCarthy,TBI,Max O'Brien,"John McCarthy explores the therapeutic benefits of watching the river flow and assesses the spiritual significance of rivers as sites of ritual and prayer.<br/><br/>The power of rivers to cleanse not just the body but the soul too is a common religious theme. John examines the baptism of Jesus and the centrality of the River Ganges to the Hindus.<br/><br/>John marvels at a river's ability to detach us from the hectic world around us and from the churning of inner thoughts and concerns. He notes that, when staring into the water, even a monolithic city building becomes broken up into a collage of dancing reflected shapes, at once beautiful and emotionally manageable.<br/><br/>Rivers are constantly moving, alive almost, forever changing and developing. Like us, they are on a journey - perhaps, John wonders, that's why it's easy to see something of our own lives in theirs.<br/><br/>In order to tell his story, John draws upon the music of Johnny Flynn and Laura Marling, Bassekou Kouyaté and Ngoni Ba, and Joni Mitchell. Readings include historian Peter Ackroyd's homage to the Thames, Robert Southey's stunning poetic depiction of the Ganges and Mary Kienholz poetic reminder that, like all great rivers, the Columbia River is a wild and untamed beast at heart.",
We're Not out of the Woods,b08cqq71,TRUE,5/2/2017,Michael Symmons Roberts,TBI,Michael Wakelin,"Michael Symmons Roberts goes into the depths of the forest to find out the meaning of the cliché ""we're not out of the woods yet"". From the time we are children, woods and forests are portrayed as places of menace and foreboding, where dangerous creatures like wolves and gruffalos lurk, intent on causing us harm. Normally they are places we want to escape from, but not everyone is so keen to get out.<br/><br/>For authors, poets and composers, the woods can be places of creativity, testing and transformation and a symbol not only of fertility - as it is for DH Lawrence - but also for the very health of a nation, as W.H Auden so powerfully expresses: ""This great society is going to smash; They cannot fool us with how fast they go, How much they cost each other and the gods. A culture is no better than its woods.""<br/><br/>Modern poetry and music also engage with the symbolism of the woods. We hear from Emily Berry and her beautiful poem Canopy, as well as Alice Oswald's Wood Not Yet Out and - perhaps surprisingly - from rock star Prince, whose song The Cross powerfully captures the emotion of the crucifixion. Roberts revisits the notion that, in literature, it is hard to escape the link between wood and the cross of Christ. He quotes the great Anglo Saxon poem The Dream of the Rood, where the cross itself is the narrator.<br/><br/>Roberts concludes that maybe being in the woods is not all bad. ""Like all the richest metaphors...there's something so deep rooted about the woods, the forest, trees as symbols and metaphors that we can't leave them alone... We're not out of the woods yet, but perhaps we don't want to be.""",

As a journalist, Mark Tully worries that his profession sometimes exacerbates a growing sense of world weariness.<br/><br/>At times, the sheer volume of awful stories in the news can be utterly overwhelming - that there's a temptation to despair completely, is hardly surprising. How should we overcome world weariness, improve our lot and maintain a zest for life?<br/><br/>In many faiths despair is a sin, and it is commonly seen as a social ill. Yet in the nineteenth century, the Romantic movement coined the word 'Weltschmerz', which was seen as a spur to achievement and the natural ally of idealism. So is weariness with the world something we can harness and use to improve life?<br/><br/>Mark talks to the journalist and writer on ethics and international development, Paul Vallely, and presents readings by the poet Paul Birtill and the Vietnamese Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh.<br/><br/>There is music from Mahalia Jackson, Tracy Chapman and John Corigliano.<br/><br/>The readers are David Holt and Francis Cadder",

Prayer is the main theme of the programme, and The Dean talks personally about how and why he prays, including an admission that before any great State Service involving the Queen, he sends up a quick 'stiffening' arrow of prayer.<br/><br/>The programme includes prayers by some of those who are buried in the Abbey, like Charles Dickens, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Sir Isaac Newton. The music too is by the great musicians commemorated there: Handel, Purcell, Stanford, and Noel Coward, whose moving wartime song 'London Pride' celebrates the spirit of the Blitz. Other readings include an account of Charles II's coronation in the Abbey by Samuel Pepys - as always just as interested in the fine ladies as the spectacle going on round him; and a sharp satire on prayer by John Betjeman.<br/><br/>A programme which evokes the awe of a very beautiful sacred space - but which is also witty, and lively, never too solemn.",

What Would Happen If?,b08wmjnw,TRUE,2/7/2017,Malcolm Doney,TBI,Jonathan O'Sullivan,"Writer and priest Malcolm Doney argues that imagination is central to almost every decision we make. For Malcolm, conscious, imaginative thinking is essentially the basis of what it means to be human.<br/><br/>Malcolm draws upon the story of Jesus who himself left no written manifesto. In his physical absence, Jesus' followers were left with the imaginative project of living lives modelled on his. They had to re-imagine a new life without him.<br/><br/>Malcolm explores the work of Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, historian Yuval Noah Harari, as well as poets John Koethe and Emily Dickinson. Using this diverse array of sources, Malcolm reveals that imagination is vital to the progress of science and lies at the beating heart of music. He concludes that ultimately, imagination is fundamental to empathy and at the core of that most life-giving command ""love thy neighbour as thyself"".",

Shoshana explains that each of her names ""reflects an essential part of my identity, although none of them capture the entirety of my true self.""<br/><br/>With readings from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, along with Leonard Bernstein's adaptation in West Side Story, Shoshana hears how names also have the power to divide us.<br/><br/>The process of naming is inextricably linked to power. Those in charge can strip us of our names. Shoshana references the dehumanising effect of names becoming numbers during the Holocaust. Listening to Les Misérables, Shoshana hears how the prisoner Jean Valjean battles to retain his own name when a police inspector refers to him only as 24601.<br/><br/>For Shoshana, perhaps the most powerful aspect of names is when a name is gifted to another. Giving a name, as Shoshana argues, ""is part of the creative act itself... we express our deep connection to something larger than ourselves - perhaps even to the One who is beyond all names.""",

What do we do when new revelations throw past convictions into doubt? Samira Ahmed reflects on times when existing certainties in people and events are shaken; when trust is tested.<br/><br/>Is there anything we can be truly certain of in life? Our sense of self might alter with age and experience. The most solid relationship could change or end. Even our most heartfelt beliefs could falter. In the wider world, we might place trust in things communally as a society; things we feel we should be confident of, like financial institutions or the labels on our food. Even with a healthy dose of scepticism, do we need to invest a degree of certainty or trust, for society to work?<br/><br/>When something goes wrong - particularly in these uncertain times - do we feel that trust or faith has been shaken? History has many examples of existing certainties crumbling in the face of new revelations, especially from the world of science.<br/><br/>Perhaps absolute certainty about anything is rare. Maybe most things in life we might feel certain of - people, situations, ourselves - are prone to be shaken up from time to time. In the programme, we hear the Reverend Canon David Reindorp share his experience of depression; a period of great insecurity for him.<br/><br/>The programme includes readings from Angela Carter, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Walt Whitman with music by Etta James, Stephen Sondheim and Sir William Herschel.",

These letters, read by Irma Kurtz, form the central part of a programme that examines the rituals, intimacies and sustaining qualities of old-fashioned letter-writing.<br/><br/>Julie also draws on 'wise words' to correspondents by Lewis Carroll, read by Jonathan Keeble, and 'audio postcards' from the author Rick Moody and the founder of analogue magazine The Radio Post, Simon Roche, and sets the entire programme to a soundtrack by the Canadian pianist Gonzales - a favourite choice of music to accompany letter-writing.<br/><br/>'Yours Truly' is at once a celebration of an art which technology is in danger of drowning out, a monument to a dearly beloved relative and a 'call to pens'.",
